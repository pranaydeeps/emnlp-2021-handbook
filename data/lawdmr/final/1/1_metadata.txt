Abstract#==#In this paper we investigate the possibility of
extracting predicate-argument relations from
UD trees (and enhanced UD graphs). Con-
cretely, we apply UD parsers on an En-
glish question answering/semantic-role label-
ing data set (FitzGerald et al., 2018) and check
if the annotations reflect the relations in the
resulting parse trees, using a small number
of rules to extract this information. We find
that 79.1% of the argument-predicate pairs can
be found in this way, on the basis of Ud-
ify (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019). Error anal-
ysis reveals that half of the error cases are at-
tributable to shortcomings in the dataset. The
remaining errors are mostly due to predicate-
argument relations not being extractible algo-
rithmically from the UD trees (requiring se-
mantic reasoning to be resolved). The parser
itself is only responsible for a small portion
of errors. Our analysis suggests a number of
improvements to the UD annotation schema:
we propose to enhance the schema in four
ways, in order to capture argument-predicate
relations. Additionally, we propose improve-
ments regarding data collection for question
answering/semantic-role labeling data.
