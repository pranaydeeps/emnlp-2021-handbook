Abstract#==#We address the sampling bias and outlier issues in few-shot learning for event detection,
a subtask of information extraction. We propose to model the relations between training
tasks in episodic few-shot learning by introducing cross-task prototypes. We further propose
to enforce prediction consistency among classifiers across tasks to make the model more
robust to outliers. Our extensive experiment shows a consistent improvement on three few-shot
learning datasets. The findings suggest that our model is more robust when labeled
data of novel event types is limited. The source code is available at http://github.com/laiviet/fsl-proact.
