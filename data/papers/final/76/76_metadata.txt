Abstract#==#Vector space word representations are learned from distributional information
of words
in large corpora. Although such statistics are semantically informative, they
disregard the valuable information that is contained in semantic lexicons such
as WordNet, FrameNet, and the Paraphrase Database.
This paper proposes a method for refining vector space representations using
relational information from semantic lexicons by encouraging linked words to
have similar vector representations, and it makes no assumptions about how the
input vectors were constructed. Evaluated on a battery of standard lexical
semantic evaluation tasks in several languages, we obtain substantial
improvements starting with a variety of word vector models. Our refinement
method outperforms prior techniques for incorporating semantic lexicons into
the word vector training algorithms.
