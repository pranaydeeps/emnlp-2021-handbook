Abstract#==#The task of Named Entity Disambiguation is to map entity mentions in the
document to their correct entries in some knowledge base. We present a novel
graph-based disambiguation approach based on Personalized PageRank (PPR) that
combines local and global evidence for disambiguation and effectively filters
out noise introduced by in- correct candidates. Experiments show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art ap- proaches by achieving 91.7% in micro-
and 89.9% in macroaccuracy on a dataset of 27.8K named entity mentions.
