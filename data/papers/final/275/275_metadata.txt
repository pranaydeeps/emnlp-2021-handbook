Abstract#==#Word embedding has been found to be highly powerful to translate words from one
language to another by a simple linear transform. However, we found some
inconsistence among the objective functions of the embedding and the transform
learning, as well as the distance measuring. This paper proposes a solution
which normalizes the word vectors on a hypersphere and constrains the linear
transform as a orthogonal transform. The experimental results  confirmed that
the proposed solution can offer better performance on a word similarity task
and an English-to-Spanish word translation task.
