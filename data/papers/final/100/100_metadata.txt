Abstract#==#We present a language agnostic, unsupervised method for inducing morphological
transformations between words. The method relies on certain regularities
manifest in high-dimensional vector spaces. We show that this method is capable
of discovering a wide range of morphological rules, which in turn are used to
build morphological analyzers. We evaluate this method across six different
languages and nine datasets, and show significant improvements across all
languages.
