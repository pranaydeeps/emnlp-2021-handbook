Abstract#==#We present IndoBERTweet, the first large-scale pretrained model for Indonesian Twitter that is trained by extending a
monolingually-trained Indonesian BERT model with additive domain-specific vocabulary. We focus in particular on efficient model adaptation under vocabulary mismatch, and benchmark different ways of initializing the BERT
embedding layer for new word types. We find that initializing with the average BERT subword embedding makes  pretraining five times faster, and is more effective than proposed methods for vocabulary adaptation in terms of extrinsic evaluation over seven Twitter-based datasets.
