Abstract#==#Text moderation for user generated content, which helps to promote healthy interaction among users, has been widely studied 
and many machine learning models have been proposed. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective
by augmenting reactive reviews with proactive forecasting. 
Specifically, we propose a new concept text toxicity propensity to characterize the extent to which a text tends to attract toxic comments. Beta regression is then introduced to 
do the probabilistic modeling, 
which is demonstrated to function well in comprehensive experiments. We also propose an explanation method to communicate the model decision clearly. 
Both propensity scoring and interpretation benefit text moderation in a novel manner. 
Finally, the proposed scaling mechanism for the linear model offers useful insights beyond this work.
