Abstract#==#Methods of deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated superior
performance on a number of natural language processing tasks. However, in most
previous work, the models are learned based on either unsupervised objectives,
which does not directly optimize the desired task, or single- task supervised
objectives, which often suffer from insufficient training data. We develop a
multi-task DNN for learning representations across multiple tasks, not only
leveraging large amounts of cross-task data, but also benefiting from a
regularization effect that leads to more general representations to help tasks
in new domains. Our multi-task DNN approach combines tasks of multiple-domain
classification (for query classification) and information retrieval (ranking
for web search), and demonstrates significant gains over strong baselines in a
comprehensive set of domain adaptation and other multi-task learning
experiments.
