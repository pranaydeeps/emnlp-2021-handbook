Abstract#==#Research on automatically geolocating social media users 
  has conventionally been based on the text content of posts from a
  given user or the social network of the user, with very little
  crossover between the two, and no benchmarking of the two approaches
  over comparable datasets. We bring the two threads of research
  together in first proposing a text-based method based on
  adaptive grids,
  followed by a hybrid network- and text-based method. 
  Evaluating over
  three Twitter datasets, we show that the empirical difference between
  text- and network-based methods is not great, and that hybridisation
  of the two is superior to the component methods, especially in contexts
  where the user graph is not well connected. We achieve
  state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.
