Abstract#==#Speech transcripts often only capture semantic content, omitting disfluencies
that can be useful for analyzing social dynamics of a discussion. This work
describes steps in building a model that can recover a large fraction of
locations where disfluencies were present, by transforming carefully annotated
text to match the standard transcription style, introducing a two-stage model
for handling different types of disfluencies, and applying semi-supervised
learning. Experiments show improvement in disfluency detection on Supreme Court
oral arguments, nearly 23% improvement in F1.
