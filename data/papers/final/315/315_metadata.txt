Abstract#==#We define a restricted class of non-projective trees that 1) covers many
natural language sentences; and 2) can be parsed exactly with a generalization
of the popular arc-eager system for projective trees (Nivre, 2003). Crucially,
this generalization only adds constant overhead in run-time and space keeping
the parserâ€™s total run-time linear in the worst case. In empirical
experiments, our proposed transition-based parser is more accurate on average
than both the arc-eager system or the swap-based system, an unconstrained
non-projective transition system with a worst-case quadratic runtime (Nivre,
2009).
