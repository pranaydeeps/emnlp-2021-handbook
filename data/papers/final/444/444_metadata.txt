Abstract#==#Linguistic similarity is multi-faceted. For instance, two words may be similar
with respect to semantics, syntax, or morphology inter alia. Continuous
word-embeddings have been shown to capture most of these shades of similarity
to some degree. This work considers guiding word-embeddings with
morphologically annotated data, a form of semi-supervised learning,
encouraging the vectors to encode a word’s morphology, i.e., words close in
the embedded space share morphological features. We extend the log-bilinear
model to this end and show that indeed our learned embeddings achieve this,
using German as a case study.
