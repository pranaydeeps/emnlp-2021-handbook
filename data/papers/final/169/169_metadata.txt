Abstract#==#We present a novel evaluation method for grammatical error correction that
addresses problems with previous approaches and scores systems in terms of
improvement on the original text. Our method evaluates corrections at the token
level using a globally optimal alignment between the source, a system
hypothesis and a reference. Unlike the M<sup>2</sup> Scorer, our method
provides scores for both detection and correction and is sensitive to different
types of edit operations.
