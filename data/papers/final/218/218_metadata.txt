Abstract#==#One of the weaknesses of current supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD)
systems is that they only treat a word as a discrete entity. However, a
continuous-space representation of words (word embeddings) can provide valuable
information and thus improve generalization accuracy. Since word embeddings are
typically obtained from unlabeled data using unsupervised methods, this method
can be seen as a semi-supervised word sense disambiguation approach. This paper
investigates two ways of incorporating word embeddings in a word sense
disambiguation setting and evaluates these two methods on some SensEval/SemEval
lexical sample and all-words tasks and also a domain-specific lexical sample
task. The obtained results show that such representations consistently improve
the accuracy of the selected supervised WSD system. Moreover, our experiments
on a domain-specific dataset show that our supervised baseline system beats the
best knowledge-based systems by a large margin.
