Abstract#==#Monolingual alignment models have been shown to boost the performance of
question answering systems by "bridging the lexical chasm" between questions
and answers. The main limitation of these approaches is that they require
semistructured training data in the form of question-answer pairs, which is
difficult to obtain in specialized domains or low-resource languages. We
propose two inexpensive methods for training alignment models solely using free
text, by generating artificial question-answer pairs from discourse structures.
Our approach is driven by two representations of discourse: a shallow
sequential representation, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory.
We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and
domains: one from Yahoo! Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types
of non-factoid questions: manner and reason. We show that these alignment
models trained directly from discourse structures imposed on free text improve
performance considerably over an information retrieval baseline and a neural
network language model trained on the same data.
