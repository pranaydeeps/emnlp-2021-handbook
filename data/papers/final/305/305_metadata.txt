Abstract#==#This paper describes a simple and principled approach to automatically
construct sentiment lexicons using distant supervision.
We induce the sentiment association scores for the lexicon items from a model
trained on a weakly supervised corpora.
Our empirical findings show that features extracted from such a machine-learned
lexicon outperform models using manual or other automatically constructed
sentiment lexicons. Finally, our system achieves the state-of-the-art in
Twitter Sentiment Analysis tasks from Semeval-2013 and ranks 2nd best in
Semeval-2014 according to the average rank.
