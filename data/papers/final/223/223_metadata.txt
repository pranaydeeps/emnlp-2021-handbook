Abstract#==#We present a new context-aware method for lexical simplification that uses two
free lan- guage resources and real web frequencies. We compare it with the
state-of-the-art method for lexical simplification in Spanish and the
established simplification baseline, that is, the most frequent synonym. Our
method improves upon the other methods in the detection of complex words, in
meaning preservation, and in simplicity. Although we use Spanish, the method
can be extended to other languages since it does not require alignment of
parallel corpora.
