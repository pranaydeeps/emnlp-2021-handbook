Abstract#==#This work presents a flexible and efficient discriminative training approach
for 
statistical machine translation.
We propose to use the RPROP algorithm for optimizing a maximum expected 
BLEU objective and experimentally compare it to several other updating schemes.
It proves to be more efficient and effective
than the previously proposed growth transformation technique and
also yields better results than stochastic gradient descent and AdaGrad.
We also report strong empirical results on two large scale tasks, namely BOLT
Chinese->English and WMT German->English, where our final systems
outperform results reported by Setiawan and Zhou (2013)
and on matrix.statmt.org. On the WMT task, discriminative
training is performed on the full training data of 4M sentence pairs,
which is unsurpassed in the literature.
