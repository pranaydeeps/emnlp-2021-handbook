Abstract#==#We present a large-scale Native Language Identification (NLI) experiment on new
data, with a focus on cross-corpus evaluation to identify corpus- and
genre-independent language transfer features. We test a new corpus and show it
is comparable to other NLI corpora and suitable for this task. Cross-corpus
evaluation on two large corpora achieves good accuracy and evidences the
existence of reliable language transfer features, but lower performance also
suggests that NLI models are not completely portable across corpora. Finally,
we present a brief case study of features distinguishing Japanese learners'
English writing, demonstrating the presence of cross-corpus and cross-genre
language transfer features that are highly applicable to SLA and ESL research.
