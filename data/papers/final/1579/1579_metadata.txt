Abstract#==#Pre-trained language-vision models have
shown remarkable performance on the visual
question answering (VQA) task. However,
most pre-trained models are trained by only
considering monolingual learning, especially
the resource-rich language like English.
Training such models for multilingual setups demand high computing resources and
multilingual language-vision dataset which
hinders their application in practice. To
alleviate these challenges, we propose a
knowledge distillation approach to extend
an English language-vision model (teacher)
into an equally effective multilingual and
code-mixed model (student). Unlike the existing knowledge distillation methods, which
only use the output from the last layer of the
teacher network for distillation, our student
model learns and imitates the teacher from
multiple intermediate layers (language and
vision encoders) with appropriately designed
distillation objectives for incremental knowledge extraction. We also create the large-scale
multilingual and code-mixed VQA dataset in
eleven different language setups considering
the multiple Indian and European languages.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis
show the effectiveness of the proposed VQA
model over the pre-trained language-vision
models on eleven diverse language setups.
