Abstract#==#Marketing materials such as flyers and other infographics are a vast online
resource. In a number of industries, such as the commercial real estate
industry, they are in fact the only authoritative source of information.
Companies attempting to organize commercial real estate inventories spend a
significant amount of resources on manual data entry of this information. In
this work, we propose a method for extracting structured data from free-form
commercial real estate flyers in PDF and HTML formats. We modeled the problem
as text categorization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and applied a
supervised machine learning approach (Support Vector Machines). Our dataset
consists of more than 2,200 commercial real estate flyers and associated
manually entered structured data, which was used to automatically create
training datasets. Traditionally, text categorization and NER approaches are
based on textual information only. However, information in visually rich
formats such as PDF and HTML is often conveyed by a combination of textual and
visual features. Large fonts, visually salient colors, and positioning often
indicate the most relevant pieces of information. We applied novel features
based on visual characteristics in addition to traditional text features and
show that performance improved significantly for both the text categorization
and NER tasks.
