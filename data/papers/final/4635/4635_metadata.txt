Abstract#==#There is a growing consensus that surface form alone does not enable models to learn meaning  and  gain  language  understanding.    This warrants  an  interest  in  hybrid  systems  that combine the strengths of neural and symbolic methods.   We favour triadic systems consisting of neural networks, knowledge bases, and inference engines.  The network provides perception, that is, the interface between the system and its environment. The knowledge base provides  explicit memory and  thus  immediate access to established facts.  Finally, inference capabilities are provided by the inference engine which reflects on the perception, supported by memory, to reason and discover new facts. In this work, we probe six popular language models for semantic relations and outline a future line of research to study how the constituent subsystems can be jointly realised and integrated.
