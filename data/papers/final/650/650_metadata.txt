Abstract#==#This paper presents an annotation scheme for adding entity and event target
annotations to the MPQA corpus, a rich span-annotated opinion corpus. The new
corpus promises to be a valuable new resource for developing systems for
entity/event-level sentiment analysis. Such systems, in turn, would be valuable
in NLP applications such as Automatic Question Answering. We introduce the idea
of entity and event targets (eTargets), describe the annotation scheme, and
present the results of an agreement study.
