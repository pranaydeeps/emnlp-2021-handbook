Abstract#==#\textbf{P}re-\textbf{T}rained \textbf{M}odel\textbf{s} have been widely applied and recently proved vulnerable under backdoor attacks:
the released pre-trained weights can be maliciously poisoned with certain triggers. 
When the triggers are activated, even the fine-tuned model will predict pre-defined labels, causing a security threat. 
These backdoors generated by the poisoning methods can be erased by changing hyper-parameters during fine-tuning or detected by finding the triggers.
In this paper, we propose a stronger weight-poisoning attack method that introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper backdoors; we also introduce a combinatorial trigger that cannot be easily detected.
The experiments on text classification tasks show that previous defense methods cannot resist our weight-poisoning method, which indicates that our method can be widely applied and may provide hints for future model robustness studies.
