Abstract#==#We present a new approach to harvesting a large-scale, high quality
image-caption corpus that makes a better use of already existing web data with
no additional human efforts. The key idea is to focus on Déjà Image-Captions:
naturally existing image descriptions that are repeated almost verbatim – by
more than one individual for different images. The resulting corpus provides
association structure between 4 million images with 180K unique captions,
capturing a rich spectrum of everyday narratives including figurative and
pragmatic language. Exploring the use of the new corpus, we also present new
conceptual tasks of visually situated paraphrasing, creative image captioning,
and creative visual paraphrasing.
