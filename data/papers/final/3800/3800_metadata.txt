Abstract#==#What do linguistic models reveal about the emotions associated with words?  In this study, we consider the task of estimating word-level emotion intensity scores for specific emotions, exploring unsupervised, supervised, and finally a self-supervised method of extracting emotional associations from pretrained vectors and models. Overall, we find that linguistic models carry substantial potential for inducing fine-grained emotion intensity scores, showing a far higher correlation with human ground truth ratings than state-of-the-art emotion lexicons based on labeled data.
