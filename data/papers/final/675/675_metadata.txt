Abstract#==#Cross-lingual text classification is a major challenge in natural language
processing, since often training data is available in only one language (target
language), but not available for the language of the document we want to
classify (source language).
Here, we propose a method that only requires a bilingual dictionary to bridge
the language gap.
Our proposed probabilistic model allows us to estimate translation
probabilities that are conditioned on the whole source document. The assumption
of our probabilistic model is that each document can be characterized by a
distribution over topics that help to solve the translation ambiguity of single
words. Using the derived translation probabilities, we then calculate the
expected word frequency of each word type in the target language. Finally,
these expected word frequencies can be used to classify the source text with
any classifier that was trained using only target language documents.
Our experiments confirm the usefulness of our proposed method.
