Abstract#==#This paper addresses the problem of morphological modeling in
statistical speech-to-speech translation for English to Iraqi
Arabic. An analysis of user data from a real-time MT-based dialog
system showed that generating correct verbal inflections is a key
problem for this language pair. We approach this problem by enriching
the training data with morphological information derived from
source-side dependency parses. We analyze the performance of several
parsers as well as the effect on different types of translation
models.  Our method achieves an improvement of more than a full BLEU
point and a significant increase in verbal inflection accuracy; at the
same time, it is computationally inexpensive and does not rely on
target-language linguistic tools.
