Abstract#==#Documents as short as a single sentence may inadvertently reveal
sensitive information about their authors, including e.g. their gender
or ethnicity. Style transfer is an effective way of transforming texts
in order to remove any information that enables author
profiling. However, for a number of current state-of-the-art
approaches the improved privacy is accompanied by an undesirable drop
in the down-stream utility of the transformed data.

In this paper, we propose a simple, zero-shot way to effectively lower the risk of author
profiling through multilingual back-translation using off-the-shelf translation models. We
compare our models with five representative text style transfer models
on three datasets across different domains. Results from both an
automatic and a human evaluation show that our approach achieves the
best overall performance while requiring no training data. We are able to lower the adversarial prediction of gender and race by up to $22\%$ while retaining $95\%$ of the original utility on downstream tasks.
