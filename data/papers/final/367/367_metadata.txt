often do
not
contain any functional nodes, while surface-syntactic structures or a chain of
tokens in a linearized tree contain all of them.  Therefore, data-driven
linguistic generation needs to be able to cope with the projection between
non-isomorphic structures that differ in their topology and number of nodes.
So far, such a projection has been a challenge in data-driven generation and
was largely avoided. We present a fully stochastic generator that is able to
cope with projection between non-isomorphic structures. The  generator, which
starts from PropBank-like structures, consists of a cascade of SVM-classifier
based submodules that map in a series of transitions the input structures onto
sentences. The generator has been evaluated for English on the Penn-Treebank
and for Spanish on the multi-layered Ancora-UPF corpus.
