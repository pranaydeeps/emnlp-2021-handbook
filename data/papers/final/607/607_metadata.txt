Abstract#==#Vectorial representations derived from large current events datasets such as
Google News have been shown to perform well on word similarity tasks. This
paper shows vectorial representations derived from substantially smaller
explanatory text datasets such as English Wikipedia and Simple English
Wikipedia preserve enough lexical semantic information to make these kinds of
category judgments with equal or better accuracy. Analysis shows these results
are driven by a prevalence of commonsense facts in explanatory text. These
positive results for small datasets suggest vectors derived from slower but
more accurate deep parsers may be practical for lexical semantic applications.
