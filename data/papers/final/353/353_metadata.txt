Abstract#==#Character n-grams have been identified as the most successful feature in both
single-domain and cross-domain Authorship Attribution (AA), but the reasons for
their discriminative value were not fully understood. We identify subgroups of
character n-grams that correspond to linguistic aspects commonly claimed to be
covered by these features: morpho-syntax, thematic content and style. We
evaluate the predictiveness of each of these groups in two AA settings: a
single domain setting and a cross-domain setting where multiple topics are
present. We demonstrate that character $n$-grams that capture information about
affixes and punctuation account for almost all of the power of character
n-grams as features. Our study contributes new insights into the use of n-grams
for future AA work and other classification tasks.
