Abstract#==#Biases continue to be prevalent in modern text
and media, especially subjective bias â€“ a special type of bias that introduces improper attitudes or presents a statement with the presupposition of truth. To tackle the problem of detecting and further mitigating subjective bias,
we introduce a manually annotated parallel
corpus WIKIBIAS with more than 4,000 sentence pairs from Wikipedia edits. This corpus
contains annotations towards both sentence-level bias types and token-level biased segments. We present systematic analyses of our
dataset and results achieved by a set of state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three tasks: bias
classification, tagging biased segments, and
neutralizing biased text. We find that current
models still struggle with detecting multi-span
biases despite their reasonable performances,
suggesting that our dataset can serve as a useful research benchmark. We also demonstrate
that models trained on our dataset can generalize well to multiple domains such as news
and political speeches.
