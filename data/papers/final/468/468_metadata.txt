Abstract#==#We present two simple modifications to the models in the popular Word2Vec tool,
in order to generate embeddings more suited to tasks involving syntax. The main
issue with the original models is the fact that they are insensitive to word
order. While order independence is useful for inducing semantic
representations, this leads to suboptimal results when they are used to solve
syntax-based problems. We show improvements in part-of-speech tagging and
dependency parsing using our proposed models.
