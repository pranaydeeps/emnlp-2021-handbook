Abstract#==#This paper presents CROWN, an automatically constructed extension of
WordNet that augments its taxonomy with novel lemmas from
Wiktionary. CROWN fills the important gap in WordNet's lexicon for slang,
technical, and rare lemmas, and more than doubles its current size.  In two
evaluations, we demonstrate that the construction procedure is accurate and has
a significant impact on a WordNet-based algorithm encountering novel lemmas.
