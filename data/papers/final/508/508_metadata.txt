Abstract#==#We present the first dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for shift-reduce
constituency parsing, which extends the DP idea of Huang and Sagae (2010) to
context-free grammars. To alleviate the propagation of errors from
part-of-speech tagging, we also extend the parser to take a tag lattice instead
of a fixed tag sequence. Experiments on both English and Chinese treebanks show
that our DP parser significantly improves parsing quality over non-DP
baselines, and achieves the best accuracies among empirical linear-time
parsers.
