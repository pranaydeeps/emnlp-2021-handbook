Abstract#==#Given a (static) scene, a human can effortlessly describe what is going on (who
is doing what to whom, how, and why). The process requires knowledge about the
world, how it is perceived, and described. In this paper we study the problem
of interpreting and verbalizing visual information using abstract scenes
created from collections of clip art images. We propose a model inspired by
machine translation operating over a large parallel corpus of visual relations
and linguistic descriptions. We demonstrate that this approach produces
human-like scene descriptions which are both fluent and relevant, outperforming
a number of competitive alternatives based on templates and sentence-based
retrieval.
