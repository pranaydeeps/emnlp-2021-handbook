Abstract#==#In spite of the apparent irregularity of the English spelling system, Chomsky
and Halle (1968) characterize it as “near optimal”. We investigate this
assertion using computational techniques and resources. We design an algorithm
to generate word spellings that maximize both phonemic transparency and
morphological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that the
constructed system is much closer to optimality than the traditional English
orthography.
