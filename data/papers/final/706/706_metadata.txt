Abstract#==#Voice conversion is the task of transforming a source speaker's voice so that
it sounds like a target speaker's voice. We present a GPU-friendly local
regression model for voice conversion that is capable of converting speech in
real-time and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this task. Our model uses a
new approximation for computing local regression coefficients that is
explicitly designed to preserve memory locality. As a result, our inference
procedure is amenable to efficient implementation on the GPU. Our approach is
more than 10X faster than a highly optimized CPU-based implementation, and is
able to convert speech 2.7X faster than real-time.
