Abstract#==#Conversational semantic role labeling (CSRL) is believed to be a crucial step towards dialogue understanding.
However, it remains a major challenge for existing CSRL parser to handle conversational structural information.
In this paper, we present a simple and effective architecture for CSRL which aims to address this problem.
Our model is based on a conversational structure aware graph network which explicitly encodes the speaker dependent information.
We also propose a multi-task learning method to further improve the model.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model with our proposed training objectives significantly outperforms previous baselines.
