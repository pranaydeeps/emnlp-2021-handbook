Abstract#==#Previous work on text coherence was primarily based on matching multiple
mentions of the same entity in different parts of the text; therefore, it
misses the contribution from semantically related but not necessarily
coreferential entities (e.g., Gates and Microsoft). In this paper, we capture
such semantic relatedness by leveraging world knowledge (e.g., Gates is the
person who created Microsoft), and use two existing evaluation frameworks.
First, in the unsupervised framework, we introduce semantic relatedness as an
enrichment to the original graph-based model of Guinaudeau and Strube (2013).
In addition, we incorporate semantic relatedness as additional features into
the popular entity-based model of Barzilay and Lapata (2008). Across both
frameworks, our enriched model with semantic relatedness outperforms the
original methods, especially on short documents.
