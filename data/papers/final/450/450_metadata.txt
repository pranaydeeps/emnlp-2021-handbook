Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised model for inducing signed social networks from the
content exchanged across network edges. Inference in this model solves three
problems simultaneously: (1) identifying the sign of each edge; (2)
characterizing the distribution over content for each edge type; (3) estimating
weights for triadic features that map to theoretical models such as structural
balance. We apply this model to the problem of inducing the social function of
address terms, such as Madame, comrade, and dude. On a dataset of movie
scripts, our system obtains a coherent clustering of address terms, while at
the same time making intuitively plausible judgments of the formality of social
relations in each film. As an additional contribution, we provide a
bootstrapping technique for identifying and tagging address terms in dialogue.
