Abstract#==#Semantic grammars can be applied both as a language model for a speech
recognizer and for semantic parsing, e.g. in order to map the output of a
speech recognizer into formal meaning representations. Semantic speech
recognition grammars are, however, typically created manually or learned in a
supervised fashion, requiring extensive manual effort in both cases. Aiming to
reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic
speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical
results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of
speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input
without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance
compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our
semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on
occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over
applying unweighted grammars.
