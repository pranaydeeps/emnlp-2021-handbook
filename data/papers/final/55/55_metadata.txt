Abstract#==#Syntactic linearization algorithms take a bag of input words and a set of
optional constraints, and construct an output sentence and its syntactic
derivation simultaneously. The search problem is NP-hard, and the current best
results are achieved by bottom-up best-first search.One drawback of the method
is low efficiency; and there is no theoretical guarantee that a full sentence
can be found within bounded time.We propose an alternative algorithm that
constructs output structures from left to right using beam-search.The algorithm
is based on incremental parsing algorithms. We extend the transition system so
that word ordering is performed in addition to syntactic parsing, resulting in
a linearization system that runs in guaranteed quadratic time. In standard
evaluations, our system runs an order of magnitude faster than a
state-of-the-art baseline using best-first search, with improved accuracies.
