Abstract#==#This study tackles the problem of paraphrase acquisition: achieving high
coverage as well as accuracy.  Our method first induces paraphrase patterns
from given seed paraphrases, exploiting the generality of paraphrases exhibited
by pairs of lexical variants, e.g., ``amendment'' and ``amending,'' in a fully
empirical way.                          It then searches monolingual corpora for new
paraphrases
that
match the patterns.  This can extract paraphrases comprising words that are
completely different from those of the given seeds.  In experiments, our method
expanded seed sets by factors of 42 to 206, gaining 84% to 208% more coverage
than a previous method that generalizes only identical word forms.  Human
evaluation through a paraphrase substitution test demonstrated that the newly
acquired paraphrases retained reasonable quality, given substantially
high-quality seeds.
