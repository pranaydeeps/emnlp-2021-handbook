Abstract#==#This paper studies how to incorporate the external word correlation knowledge
to improve the coherence of topic modeling. Existing topic models assume words
are generated independently and lack the mechanism to utilize the rich
similarity relationships among words to learn coherent topics. To solve this
problem, we build a Markov Random Field (MRF) regularized Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) model, which define a MRF on the latent topic layer of LDA to
encourage words labeled as similar to share the same topic label. Under our
model, the topic assignment of each word is not independent, but rather
affected by the topic labels of its correlated words. Similar words have better
chance to be put into the same topic due to the regularization of MRF, hence
the coherence of topics can be boosted. In addition, our model can accommodate
the subtlety that whether two words are similar depends on which topic they
appear in, which allows word with multiple senses to be put into different
topics properly. We derive a variational inference method to infer the
posterior probabilities and learn model parameters and present techniques to
deal with the hard-to-compute partition function in MRF. Experiments on two
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.
