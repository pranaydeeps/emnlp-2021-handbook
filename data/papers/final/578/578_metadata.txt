Abstract#==#When text is translated from one language into another, sentiment is preserved
to varying degrees. In this paper, we use Arabic social media posts as stand-in
for source language text, and determine loss in sentiment predictability when
they are translated into English, manually and automatically. As benchmarks, we
use manually and automatically determined sentiment labels of the Arabic texts.
We show that
sentiment analysis of English translations of Arabic texts produces competitive
results, w.r.t. Arabic sentiment analysis. We discover that even though
translation significantly reduces the human ability to recover sentiment,
automatic sentiment systems are still able to capture sentiment information
from the translations.
