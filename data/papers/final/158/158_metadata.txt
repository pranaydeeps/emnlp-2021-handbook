Abstract#==#This work, concerning paraphrase identification task, on one
hand contributes to expanding deep learning embeddings to
include continuous and discontinuous linguistic phrases. On
the other hand, it comes up with a new scheme TF-KLD-KNN to
learn the discriminative weights of words and phrases specific to
paraphrase task, so that a weighted sum of embeddings can
represent sentences more effectively.  Based on these two
innovations we get competitive state-of-the-art performance on
paraphrase identification.
