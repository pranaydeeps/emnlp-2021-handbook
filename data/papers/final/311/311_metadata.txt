Abstract#==#This paper reports on our research to generate multilingual semantic lexical
resources and develop multilingual semantic annotation software, which assigns
each word in running text to a semantic category based on a lexical semantic
classification scheme. Such tools have an important role in developing
intelli-gent multilingual NLP, text mining and ICT systems. In this work, we
aim to extend an existing English semantic annotation tool to cover a range of
languages, namely Italian, Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese, by boot-strapping
new semantic lexical resources via automatically translating existing English
se-mantic lexicons into these languages. We used a set of bilingual
dictionaries and word lists for this purpose. In our experiment, with minor
manual improvement of the automatically generated semantic lexicons, the
prototype tools based on the new lexicons achieved an average lexical coverage
of 79.86% and an average annotation precision of 71.42% (if only precise
annotations are considered) or 84.64% (if partially correct annotations are
included) on the three languages. Our experiment demonstrates that it is
feasible to rapidly develop prototype semantic annotation tools for new
languages by automatically bootstrapping new semantic lexicons based on
existing ones.
