Abstract#==#Relating entities and events in text is a key component of natural language understanding. Cross-document coreference resolution, in particular, is important for the growing interest in multi-document analysis tasks.
In this work we propose a new model that extends the efficient sequential prediction paradigm for coreference resolution to cross-document settings and 
achieves competitive results for both entity and event coreference while providing strong evidence of the efficacy of both sequential models and higher-order inference in cross-document settings.
Our model incrementally composes mentions into cluster representations and predicts links between a mention and the already constructed clusters,
approximating a higher-order model. 
In addition, we conduct extensive ablation studies that provide new insights into the importance of various inputs and representation types in coreference.
