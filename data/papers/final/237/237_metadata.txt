Abstract#==#We present a simple, yet effective approach to adapt part-of-speech (POS)
taggers to new domains. Our approach only requires a dictionary and large
amounts of unlabeled target data. The idea is to use the dictionary to mine the
unlabeled target data for unambiguous word sequences, thus effectively
collecting labeled target data. We add the mined instances to available labeled
newswire data to train a POS tagger for the target domain. The induced models
significantly improve tagging accuracy on held-out test sets across three
domains (Twitter, spoken language, and search queries). We also present results
for Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese Twitter data, and provide two novel
manually-annotated test sets.
