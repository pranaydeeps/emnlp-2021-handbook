Abstract#==#Most modern statistical machine translation systems are based on linear
statistical models. One extremely effective method for estimating the model
parameters is minimum error rate training (MERT), which is an efficient form of
line optimisation adapted to the highly non-linear objective functions used in
machine translation. We describe a polynomial-time generalisation of line
optimisation that computes the error surface over a plane embedded in parameter
space. The description of this algorithm relies on convex geometry, which is
the mathematics of polytopes and their faces.

Using this geometric representation of MERT we investigate whether the
optimisation of linear models is tractable in general. Previous work on finding
optimal solutions in MERT (Galley and Quirk, 2011) established a worst-case
complexity that was exponential in the number of sentences, in contrast we show
that exponential dependence in the worst-case complexity is mainly in the
number of features.

Although our work is framed with respect to MERT, the convex geometric
description is also applicable to other error-based training methods for linear
models. We believe our analysis has important ramifications because it suggests
that the current trend in building statistical machine translation systems by
introducing a very large number of sparse features is inherently not robust.
