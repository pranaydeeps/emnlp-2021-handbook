Abstract#==#Compositional embedding models build a representation
  for a linguistic structure based on its component word embeddings.
  While recent work has combined these word embeddings with hand crafted
  features for improved performance, they are limited to using a small
  number of features due to model complexity, thus limiting their
applicability.
  We propose a new model that conjoins features
  and word embeddings while maintaing a small number of parameters by 
  learning feature embeddings jointly with the parameters of a
  compositional model. The result is a method that can scale to more 
  features and more labels, which avoiding over-fitting.
  We demonstrate that our model attains state-of-the-art results
  on ACE and ERE fine-grain relation extraction.
