Abstract#==#We present a simple and yet effective approach that can incorporate rationales
elicited from annotators into the training of any off-the-shelf classifier. We
show that our simple approach is effective for multinomial naive Bayes,
logistic regression, and support vector machines. We additionally present an
active learning method tailored specifically for the learning with rationales
framework.
