Abstract#==#Solving the visual symbol grounding problem has long been a goal of artificial
intelligence. The field appears to be advancing closer to this goal with recent
breakthroughs in deep learning for natural language grounding in static images.
In this paper, we propose to translate videos directly to sentences using a
unified deep neural network with both convolutional and recurrent structure.
Described video datasets are scarce, and most existing methods have been
applied to toy domains with a small vocabulary of possible words. By  
transferring knowledge from 1.2M+ images with category labels and 100,000+
images with captions, our method is able to
create sentence descriptions of open-domain videos with large vocabularies. 
We compare our approach with recent work using language generation metrics,
subject, verb, and object prediction accuracy, and a human
evaluation.
