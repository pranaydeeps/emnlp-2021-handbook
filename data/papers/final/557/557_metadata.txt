Abstract#==#Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning semantic parsers with
indirect supervision, but existing work focuses almost exclusively on question
answering. Separately, there have been active pursuits in leveraging databases
for distant supervision in information extraction, yet such methods are often
limited to binary relations and none can handle nested events. In this paper,
we generalize distant supervision to complex knowledge extraction, by proposing
the first approach to learn a semantic parser for extracting nested event
structures without annotated examples, using only a database of such complex
events and unannotated text. The key idea is to model the annotations as latent
variables, and incorporate a prior that favors semantic parses containing known
events. Experiments on the GENIA event extraction dataset show that our
approach can learn from and extract complex biological pathway events.
Moreover, when supplied with just five example words per event type, it becomes
competitive even among supervised systems, outperforming 19 out of 24 teams
that participated in the original shared task.
