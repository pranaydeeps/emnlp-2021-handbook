Abstract#==#In this paper we present our work on recognizing high level social constructs
such as Leadership and Status from textual conversation using an approach that
makes use of the background knowledge about social hierarchy and integrates
statistical methods and symbolic logic based methods. We use a stratified
approach in which we first detect lower level language constructs such as
politeness, command and agreement that help us to infer intermediate constructs
such as deference, closeness and authority that are observed between the
parties engaged in conversation. These intermediate constructs in turn are used
to determine the social constructs Leadership and Status. We have implemented
this system successfully in both English and Korean languages and achieved
considerable accuracy.
