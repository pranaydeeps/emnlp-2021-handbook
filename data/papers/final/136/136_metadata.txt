Abstract#==#Incremental parsers have potential advantages for applications like language
modeling for machine translation and speech recognition. We describe a new
algorithm for incremental transition-based Combinatory Categorial Grammar
parsing. As English CCGbank derivations are mostly right branching and
non-incremental, we design our algorithm based on the dependencies resolved
rather than the derivation. We introduce two new actions in the shift-reduce
paradigm based on the idea of ‘revealing’ (Pareschi and Steedman, 1987) the
required information during parsing. On the standard CCGbank test data, our
algorithm achieved improvements of 0.88% in labeled and 2.0% in unlabeled
F-score over a greedy non-incremental shift-reduce parser.
