Abstract#==#We investigate the problem of predicting the quality of automatic speech
recognition (ASR) output under the following rigid constraints: i) reference
transcriptions are not available, ii) confidence information about the system
that produced the transcriptions is not accessible, and iii) training and test
data come from multiple  domains. To cope with these constraints (typical of
the constantly increasing amount of automatic transcriptions  that can be found
on the Web), we propose a domain-adaptive approach based on multitask learning.
Different algorithms and strategies are evaluated with English data coming from
four domains, showing that the proposed approach can cope with the limitations
of previously proposed single task learning methods.
