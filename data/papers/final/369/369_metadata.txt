Abstract#==#Extensive lexical knowledge is necessary for temporal analysis and planning
tasks. We ad-
dress in this paper a lexical setting that allows for the straightforward
incorporation of rich features and structural constraints. We explore a lexical
event ordering task, namely determining the likely temporal order of events
based solely on the identity of their predicates and arguments. We propose an
“edge-factored” model for the task that decomposes over the edges of the
event graph. We learn it using the structured perceptron. As lexical tasks
require large amounts of text, we do not attempt manual annotation and instead
use the textual order of events in a domain where this order is aligned with
their temporal order, namely cooking recipes.
