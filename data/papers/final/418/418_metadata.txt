Abstract#==#We present APRO, a new method for machine translation tuning that can handle
large feature sets. As opposed to other popular methods (e.g., MERT, MIRA,
PRO), which involve randomness and require multiple runs to obtain a reliable
result, APRO gives the same result on any run, given initial feature weights.
APRO follows the pairwise ranking approach of PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), but
instead of ranking a small sampled subset of pairs from the k- best list, APRO
efficiently ranks all pairs. By obviating the need for manually determined
sampling settings, we obtain more reliable results. APRO converges more quickly
than PRO and gives similar or better translation results.
