Abstract#==#In this work, we study the problem of named entity recognition (NER)  in a low resource
scenario, focusing on few-shot and zero-shot settings. Built upon large-scale pre-trained language models, we propose a novel NER framework, namely SpanNER,  which learns from natural language supervision and enables the identification of never-seen entity classes without using in-domain labeled data. We perform  extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets and evaluate the proposed method in the few-shot learning, domain transfer and zero-shot learning settings. The experimental results show that the proposed method can bring  10%, 23% and 26%  improvements in average over the best baselines in few-shot learning, domain transfer and zero-shot learning settings respectively.
