Abstract#==#Coreference is a core NLP problem. However, newswire data, the primary source
of existing coreference data, lack the richness necessary to truly solve
coreference. We present a new domain with denser references---quiz bowl
questions---that is challenging and enjoyable to humans, and we use the quiz
bowl community to develop a new coreference dataset, together with an
annotation framework that can tag any text data with coreferences and named
entities. We also successfully integrate active learning into this annotation
pipeline to collect documents maximally useful to coreference models.
State-of-the-art coreference systems underperform a simple classifier on our
new dataset, motivating non-newswire data for future coreference research.
