Abstract#==#I highlight a simple failure mode of state-of-the-art machine reading systems: when contexts do not align with commonly shared beliefs. For example, machine reading systems fail to answer {\em What did Elizabeth want?} correctly in the context of 'My kingdom for a cough drop, cried Queen Elizabeth.' Biased by co-occurrence statistics in the training data of pretrained language models, systems predict {\em my kingdom}, rather than {\em a cough drop}. I argue such biases are analogous to human belief biases and present a carefully designed challenge dataset for English machine reading, called {\sc Auto-Locke}, to quantify such effects. Evaluations of machine reading systems on {\sc Auto-Locke} show the pervasiveness of belief bias in machine reading.
