Abstract#==#Response-based learning allows to adapt a statistical machine translation (SMT)
system to an extrinsic task by extracting supervision signals from
task-specific feedback. In this paper, we elicit response signals for SMT
adaptation by executing semantic parses of translated queries against the
Freebase database.
The challenge of our work lies in scaling semantic parsers to the lexical
diversity of open-domain databases. We find that parser performance on
incorrect English sentences, which is standardly ignored in parser evaluation,
is key in model selection. In our experiments, the biggest improvements in
F1-score for returning the correct answer from a semantic parse for a
translated query are achieved by selecting a parser that is carefully enhanced
by paraphrases and synonyms.
