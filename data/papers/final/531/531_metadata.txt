Abstract#==#This paper presents a framework to infer spatial knowledge from verbal semantic
role representations. First, we generate potential spatial knowledge
deterministically. Second, we determine whether it can be inferred and a degree
of certainty. Inferences capture that something is located or is not located
somewhere, and temporally anchor this information. An annotation effort shows
that inferences are ubiquitous and intuitive to humans.
