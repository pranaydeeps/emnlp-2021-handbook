Abstract#==#Recent years has witnessed the remarkable success in end-to-end task-oriented dialog system, especially when incorporating external knowledge information.  However, the quality of most existing models' generated response is still limited, mainly due to their lack of fine-grained reasoning on deterministic knowledge  (w.r.t. conceptual tokens), which makes them difficult to capture the concept shifts and identify user's real intention in cross-task scenarios. To address these issues,  we propose a novel intention mechanism to better model deterministic entity knowledge. Based on such a mechanism,  we further propose an intention reasoning network (IR-Net), which consists of joint and multi-hop reasoning, to obtain intention-aware representations of conceptual tokens that can be used to capture the concept shifts involved in task-oriented conversations, so as to effectively identify user's intention and generate more accurate responses.  Experimental results verify the effectiveness of IR-Net, showing that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two representative multi-domain dialog datasets.
