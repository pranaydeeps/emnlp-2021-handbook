Abstract#==#Random walks over large knowledge bases like WordNet have been
  successfully used in word similarity, relatedness and disambiguation
  tasks. Unfortunately, those algorithms are relatively slow for large
  repositories, with significant memory footprints. In this paper we
  present a novel algorithm which encodes the structure of a knowledge
  base in a continuous vector space, combining random walks and neural
  net language models in order to produce novel word
  representations. Evaluation in word relatedness and similarity
  datasets yields equal or better results than those of a random walk
  algorithm, using a dense representation (300 dimensions instead of
  117K). Furthermore, the word representations are complementary to
  those of the random walk algorithm and to corpus-based continuous
  representations, improving the state-of-the-art in the similarity
  dataset. Our technique opens up exciting opportunities to combine
  distributional and knowledge-based word representations.
