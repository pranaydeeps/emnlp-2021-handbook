Abstract#==#The semantic representation of individual word senses and concepts is of
fundamental importance to several applications in Natural Language Processing.
To date, concept modeling techniques have in the main based their
representation either on lexicographic resources, such as WordNet, or on
encyclopedic resources, such as Wikipedia. We propose a vector representation
technique that combines the complementary knowledge of both these types of
resource. Thanks to its use of explicit semantics combined with a novel
cluster-based dimensionality reduction and an effective weighting scheme, our
representation attains state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets in two
standard benchmarks: word similarity and sense clustering. We are releasing our
vector representations at http://lcl.uniroma1.it/nasari/.
