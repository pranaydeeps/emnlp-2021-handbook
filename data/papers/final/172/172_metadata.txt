Abstract#==#We propose a method for simultaneously translating from a single source
language to multiple target languages T1, T2, etc. The motivation behind this
method is that if we only have a weak language model for T1 and translations in
T1 and T2 are associated, we can use the information from a strong language
model over T2 to disambiguate the translations in T1, providing better
translation results. As a specific framework to realize multi-target
translation, we expand the formalism of synchronous context-free grammars to
handle multiple targets, and describe methods for rule extraction, scoring,
pruning, and search with these models. Experiments find that multi-target
translation with a strong language model in a similar second target language
can provide gains of up to 0.8-1.5 BLEU points.
