Abstract#==#This paper introduces a tensor-based approach to semantic role labeling (SRL).
The motivation behind the approach is to automatically induce a compact feature
representation for words and their relations, tailoring them to the task. In
this sense, our dimensionality reduction method provides a clear alternative to
the traditional feature engineering approach used in SRL. To capture meaningful
interactions between the argument, predicate, their syntactic path and the
corresponding role label, we compress each feature representation first to a
lower dimensional space prior to assessing their interactions. This corresponds
to using an overall cross-product feature representation and maintaining
associated parameters as a four-way low-rank tensor. The tensor parameters are
optimized for the SRL performance using standard online algorithms. Our
tensor-based approach rivals the best performing system on the CoNLL-2009
shared task. In addition, we demonstrate that adding the representation tensor
to a competitive tensor-free model yields 2\% absolute increase in F-score.
