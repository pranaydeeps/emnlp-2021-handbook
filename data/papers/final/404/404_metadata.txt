Abstract#==#This work focuses on the insensitivity of existing word alignment models to
domain differences, which often yields suboptimal results on large
heterogeneous data. A novel latent domain word alignment model is proposed,
which induces domain-conditioned lexical and alignment statistics. We propose
to train the model on a heterogeneous corpus  under partial supervision, using
a small number of seed samples from different domains. The seed samples allow
estimating sharper, domain-conditioned word alignment statistics for sentence
pairs. Our experiments show that the derived domain-conditioned statistics,
once combined together, produce notable improvements both in word alignment
accuracy and in translation accuracy of their resulting SMT systems.
