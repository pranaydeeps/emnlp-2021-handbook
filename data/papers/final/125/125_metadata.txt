Abstract#==#A large part of human communication involves referring to entities in the world
and often these entities are objects that are visually present for the
interlocutors. A system that aims to resolve such references needs to tackle a
complex task: objects and their visual features need to be determined, the
referring expressions must be recognised, and extra-linguistic information such
as eye gaze or pointing gestures need to be incorporated. Systems that can make
use of such information sources exist, but have so far only been tested under
very constrained settings, such as WOz interactions. In this paper, we apply to
a more complex domain a reference resolution model that works incrementally
(i.e., word by word), grounds words with visually present properties of objects
(such as shape and size), and can incorporate extra-linguistic information. We
find that the model works well compared to previous work on the same data,
despite using fewer features. We conclude that the model shows potential for
use in a real-time interactive dialogue system.
