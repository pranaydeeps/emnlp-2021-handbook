Abstract#==#Definition generation techniques aim to generate a definition of a target word or phrase given a context. 
In previous studies, researchers have faced various issues such as the out-of-vocabulary problem and over/under-specificity problems. 
Over-specific definitions present narrow word meanings, whereas under-specific definitions present general and context-insensitive meanings.
Herein, we propose a method for definition generation with appropriate specificity. 
The proposed method addresses the aforementioned problems by leveraging a pre-trained encoder-decoder model, namely Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, and introducing a re-ranking mechanism to model specificity in definitions.
Experimental results on standard evaluation datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method. 
Moreover, manual evaluation confirms that our method effectively addresses the over/under-specificity problems.
