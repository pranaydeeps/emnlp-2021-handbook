Abstract#==#Distributional representations of words have been recently used in supervised
settings for recognizing lexical inference relations between word pairs, such
as hypernymy and entailment. We investigate a collection of these
state-of-the-art methods, and show that they do not actually learn a relation
between two words. Instead, they learn an independent property of a single word
in the pair: whether that word is a ``prototypical hypernym''.
