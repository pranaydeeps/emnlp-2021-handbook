Abstract#==#Current approaches to cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) rely on
standard retrieval models into which query translations by statistical machine
translation (SMT) are integrated at varying degree. In this paper, we present
an attempt to turn this situation on its head: Instead of the retrieval aspect,
we emphasize the translation component in CLIR. We perform search by using an
SMT decoder in forced decoding mode to produce a bag-of-words representation of
the target documents to be ranked. The SMT model is extended by
retrieval-specific features that are optimized jointly with standard
translation features for a ranking objective. We find significant gains over
the state-of-the-art in a large-scale evaluation on cross-lingual search in the
domains patents and Wikipedia.
