Abstract#==#We take a novel approach to zero pronoun resolution in Chinese: our model
explicitly tracks the flow of focus in a discourse. Our approach, which
generalizes to deictic references, is not reliant on the presence of overt noun
phrase antecedents to resolve to, and allows us to address the large percentage
of "non-anaphoric" pronouns filtered out in other approaches. We furthermore
train our model using readily available parallel Chinese/English corpora,
allowing for training without hand-annotated data. Our results demonstrate
improvements on two test sets, as well as the usefulness of linguistically
motivated features.
