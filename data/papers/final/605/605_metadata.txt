Abstract#==#Discourse relation classification is an important component for automatic
discourse parsing and natural language understanding. The performance
bottleneck of a discourse parser comes from implicit discourse relations, whose
discourse connectives are not overtly present. Explicit discourse connectives
can potentially be exploited to collect more training data to collect more data
and boost the performance. However, using them indiscriminately has been shown
to hurt the performance because not all discourse connectives can be dropped
arbitrarily. Based on this insight, we investigate the interaction between
discourse connectives and the discourse relations and propose the criteria for
selecting the discourse connectives that can be dropped independently of the
context without changing the interpretation of the discourse. Extra training
data collected only by the freely omissible connectives improve the performance
of the system without additional features.
