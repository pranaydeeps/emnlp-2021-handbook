Abstract#==#We present a two-stage framework to parse a sentence into its Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR). We first use a dependency parser to generate a dependency
tree for the sentence. In the second stage, we design a novel transition-based
algorithm that transforms the dependency tree to an AMR graph. There are
several advantages with this approach. First, the dependency parser can be
trained on a training set much larger than the training set for the
tree-to-graph algorithm, resulting in a more accurate AMR parser overall. Our
parser yields an improvement of 5% absolute in F-measure over the best previous
result. Second, the actions that we design are linguistically intuitive and
capture the regularities in the mapping between the dependency structure and
the AMR of a sentence. Third, our parser runs in nearly linear time in practice
in spite of a worst-case complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
