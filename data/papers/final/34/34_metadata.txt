Abstract#==#Two goals are targeted by computer philology for ancient manuscript corpora:
firstly, making an edition, that is roughly speaking one text version
representing the whole corpus, which contains variety induced through copy
errors and other processes and secondly, producing a stemma. A stemma is a
graph-based visualization of the copy history with manuscripts as nodes and
copy events as edges. Its root, the so-called archetype, is the supposed
original text or urtext from which all subsequent copies are made. Our main
contribution is to present one of the first computational approaches to
automatic archetype reconstruction and to introduce the first text-based
evaluation for automatically produced archetypes. We compare a philologically
generated archetype with one generated by bio-informatic software.
