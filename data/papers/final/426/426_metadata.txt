Abstract#==#In September 2014, Twitter users unequivocally reacted to the Ray Rice assault
scandal by unleashing personal stories of domestic abuse via the hashtags
#WhyIStayed or #WhyILeft. We explore at a macro-level firsthand accounts of
domestic abuse from a substantial, balanced corpus of tweeted instances
designated with these tags. To seek insights into the reasons victims give for
staying in vs. leaving abusive relationships, we analyze the corpus using
linguistically motivated methods. We also report on an annotation study for
corpus assessment. We perform classification, contributing a classifier that
discriminates between the two hashtags exceptionally well at 82% accuracy with
a substantial error reduction over its baseline.
