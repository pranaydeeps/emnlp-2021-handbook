Abstract#==#We present a novel abstractive summarization framework that draws on the recent
development of a treebank for the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). In
this framework, the source text is parsed to a set of AMR graphs, the graphs
are transformed into a summary graph, and then text is generated from the
summary graph. We focus on the graph-to-graph transformation that reduces the
source semantic graph into a summary graph, making use of an existing AMR
parser and assuming the eventual availability of an AMR-to-text generator. The
framework is data-driven, trainable, and not specifically designed for a
particular domain. Experiments on gold-standard AMR annotations and system
parses show promising results. Code is available at:
