Abstract#==#Multi-document Summarization (MDS) is of great value to many real world
applications. Many scoring models are proposed to select appropriate sentences
from documents to form the summary, in which the clusterbased methods are
popular. In this work, we propose a unified sentence scoring model which
measures representativeness and diversity at the same time. Experimental
results on DUC04 demonstrate that our MDS method outperforms the DUC04 best
method and the existing cluster-based methods, and it yields close results
compared to the state-of-the-art generic MDS methods. Advantages of the
proposed MDS method are two-fold: (1) The density peaks clustering algorithm is
adopted, which is effective and fast. (2) No external resources such as Wordnet
and Wikipedia or complex language parsing algorithms is used, making
reproduction and deployment very easy in
real environment.
