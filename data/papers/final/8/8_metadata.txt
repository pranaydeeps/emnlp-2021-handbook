Abstract#==#The rapid growth of information sources
brings a unique challenge to biographical
information extraction: how to find specific
facts without having to read all the words.
An effective solution is to follow the human
scanning strategy which keeps a specific
keyword in mind and searches within a
specific scope. In this paper, we mimic a
scanning process to extract biographical
facts: we use event and relation triggers as
keywords, identify their scopes and apply
type constraints to extract answers within the
scope of a trigger. Experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods up to 26% absolute gain in F-score
without using any syntactic analysis or
external knowledge bases.
