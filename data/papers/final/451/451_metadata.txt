Abstract#==#A common approach to dependency parsing is scoring a parse via a linear
function of a set of indicator features. These features are typically manually
constructed from templates that are applied to parts of the parse tree. The
templates define which properties of a part should combine to create features.
Existing approaches consider only a small subset of the possible combinations,
due to statistical and computational efficiency considerations. In this work we
present a novel kernel which facilitates efficient parsing with feature
representations corresponding to a much larger set of combinations. 
We integrate the kernel into a parse reranking system and demonstrate its
effectiveness on four languages from the CoNLL-X shared task.
