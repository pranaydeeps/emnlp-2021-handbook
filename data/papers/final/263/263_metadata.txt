Abstract#==#We present an approach to speech recognition that uses only a neural network to
map acoustic input to characters, a character-level language model, and a beam
search decoding procedure. This approach eliminates much of the complex
infrastructure of modern speech recognition systems, making it possible to
directly train a speech recognizer using errors generated by spoken language
understanding tasks. The system naturally handles out of vocabulary words and
spoken word fragments. We demonstrate our approach using the challenging
Switchboard telephone conversation transcription task, achieving a word error
rate competitive with existing baseline systems. To our knowledge, this is the
first entirely neural-network-based system to achieve strong speech
transcription results on a conversational speech task. We analyze qualitative
differences between transcriptions produced by our lexicon-free approach and
transcriptions produced by a standard speech recognition system. Finally, we
evaluate the impact of large context neural network character language models
as compared to standard n-gram models within our framework.
