Abstract#==#This paper presents the first attempt to use word embeddings to
  predict the compositionality of multiword expressions. We consider
  both single- and multi-prototype word embeddings. Experimental results
  show that, in combination with a back-off method based on string
  similarity, word embeddings outperform a method using count-based
  distributional similarity. Our best results are competitive with, or
  superior to, state-of-the-art methods over three standard
  compositionality datasets, which include two types of multiword
  expressions and two languages.
