Abstract#==#Coreference resolution is a key problem in natural language understanding that
still escapes reliable solutions. One fundamental difficulty has been that of
resolving instances involving pronouns since they often require deep language
understanding and use of background knowledge. In this paper we propose an
algorithmic solution that involves a new representation for the knowledge
required to address hard coreference problems, along with a constrained
optimization framework that uses this knowledge in coreference decision making.
Our representation, Predicate Schemas, is instantiated with knowledge acquired
in an unsupervised way, and is compiled automatically into constraints that
impact the coreference decision. We present a general coreference resolution
system that significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on hard,
Winograd-style, pronoun resolution cases, while still performing at the
state-of-the-art level on standard coreference resolution datasets.
