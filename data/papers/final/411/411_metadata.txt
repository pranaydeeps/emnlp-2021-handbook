Abstract#==#Vector Space Models (VSMs) of Semantics are useful tools for exploring the
semantics of single words, and the composition of words to make phrasal
meaning.  While many methods can estimate the meaning (i.e. vector) of a
phrase, few do so in an interpretable way.  We introduce a new method (CNNSE)
that allows word and phrase vectors to adapt to the notion of composition.  Our
method learns a VSM that is both tailored to support a chosen semantic
composition operation, and whose resulting features have an intuitive
interpretation.  Interpretability allows for the exploration of phrasal
semantics, which we leverage to analyze performance on a behavioral task.
