Abstract#==#Open domain relation extraction systems identify relation and argument phrases 
  in a sentence without relying on any underlying schema. However, current 
  state-of-the-art relation extraction systems are
  available only for English because of their heavy reliance on 
  linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers. We 
  present a cross-lingual annotation projection method for
  language independent relation extraction. We evaluate our method
  on a manually annotated test set and present results on three
  typologically different languages. We release these manual annotations and
  extracted relations in ten languages from Wikipedia.
