Abstract#==#Natural question generation (QG) aims to generate questions from a passage, and generated questions are answered from the passage.
Most models with state-of-the-art performance model the previously generated text at each decoding step.
However, (1) they ignore the rich structure information that is hidden in the previously generated text. (2) they ignore the impact of copied words on the passage.
We perceive that information in previously generated words serves as auxiliary information in subsequent generation.
To address these problems, we design the Iterative Graph Network-based Decoder (IGND) to model the previous generation using a Graph Neural Network at each decoding step.
Moreover, our graph model captures dependency relations in the passage that boost the generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models with sentence-level QG tasks on SQuAD and MARCO datasets.
