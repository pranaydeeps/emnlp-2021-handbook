Abstract#==#Translation models often fail to generate good translations for infrequent
words or phrases. Previous work attacked this problem by inducing new
translation rules from monolingual data with a semi-supervised algorithm.
However, this approach does not scale very well since it is very
computationally expensive to generate new translation rules for only a few
thousand sentences. We propose a much faster and simpler method that directly
hallucinates translation rules for infrequent phrases based on phrases with
similar continuous representations for which a translation is known. To speed
up the retrieval of similar phrases, we investigate approximated nearest
neighbor search with redundant bit vectors which we find to be three times
faster and significantly more accurate than locality sensitive hashing. Our
approach of learning new translation rules improves a phrase-based
baseline by up to 1.6 BLEU on Arabic-English translation, it is three-orders of
magnitudes faster than existing semi-supervised methods and 0.5 BLEU more
accurate.
