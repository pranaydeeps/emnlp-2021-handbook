Abstract#==#This paper proposes a novel approach to train word embeddings to capture
antonyms. Word embeddings have shown to capture synonyms and analogies. Such
word embeddings, however, cannot capture antonyms since they depend on the
distributional hypothesis. Our approach utilizes supervised synonym and antonym
information from thesauri, as well as distributional information from
large-scale unlabelled text data. The evaluation results on the
GRE antonym question task show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems and it can answer the antonym questions in the F-score of 89%.
