Abstract#==#Previous work has debated whether humans make use of hierarchic syntax when
processing language (Frank and Bod, 2011; Fossum and Levy, 2012). This paper
uses an eye-tracking corpus to demonstrate that hierarchic syntax significantly
improves reading time prediction over a strong n-gram baseline. This study
shows that an interpolated 5-gram baseline can be made stronger by combining
n-gram statistics over entire eye-tracking regions rather than simply using the
last n-gram in each region, but basic hierarchic syntactic measures are still
able to achieve significant improvements over this improved baseline.
