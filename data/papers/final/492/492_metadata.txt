Abstract#==#This work is an attempt to automatically obtain numerical attributes of
physical objects. We propose to represent each physical object as a feature
vector and represent sizes as linear functions of feature vectors. We train the
function in the framework of the combined regression and ranking with many
types of fragmentary clues including absolute clues (e.g., A is 30cm long) and
relative clues (e.g., A is larger than B).
