Abstract#==#People vary widely in their temporal orientation --- how often they emphasize
the 
past, present, and future --- and this affects their finances, health, and
happiness. Traditionally, temporal orientation has been assessed by self-report
questionnaires. In this paper, we develop a novel behavior-based assessment
using human language on Facebook. We first create a past, present, and future
message classifier, engineering features and evaluating a variety of
classification techniques. Our message classifier achieves an accuracy of
71.8%, compared with 52.8% from the most frequent class and 58.6% from a model
based entirely on time expression features. We quantify a users’ overall
temporal orientation based on their distribution of messages and validate it
against known human correlates: conscientiousness, age, and gender. We then
explore social scientific questions, finding novel associations with the
factors openness to experience, satisfaction with life, depression, IQ, and
one’s number of friends. Further, demonstrating how one can track orientation
over time, we find differences in future orientation around birthdays.
