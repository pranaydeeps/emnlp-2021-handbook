Abstract#==#Transcribing documents from the printing press era, a challenge in its own
right, is more
complicated when documents interleave multiple languages---a common feature of
16th century texts. Additionally, many of these documents precede  
consistent orthographic conventions, making the task even harder. We extend the
state-of-the-art historical OCR model of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) to
handle
word-level code-switching between multiple languages.
Further, we enable our system to handle spelling variability, including
now-obsolete shorthand systems used by printers. Our results show average
relative character error reductions of 14\% across a variety of historical
texts.
