Abstract#==#In modern practice, labeling a dataset often involves 
aggregating annotator judgments obtained from crowdsourcing. 
State-of-the-art aggregation is performed via inference on probabilistic 
models, some of which are data-aware, meaning that they leverage 
features of the data (e.g., words in a document) in addition to annotator
judgments. 
Previous work largely prefers 
discriminatively trained conditional models. 
This paper demonstrates that a data-aware crowdsourcing 
model incorporating a generative multinomial data model enjoys 
a strong competitive advantage over its discriminative log-linear 
counterpart in the typical crowdsourcing setting. That 
is, the generative approach is better except when 
the annotators are highly accurate in which case simple 
majority vote is often sufficient. 
Additionally, we present a novel mean-field variational inference algorithm 
for the generative model that significantly improves on the 
previously reported state-of-the-art for that model. 
We validate our conclusions on six text classification datasets with 
both human-generated and synthetic annotations.
