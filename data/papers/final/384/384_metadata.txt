Abstract#==#Sparse representations of text such as bag-of-words models or extended explicit
semantic analysis (ESA) representations are commonly used in many NLP
applications. However, for short texts, the similarity between two such sparse
vectors is not accurate due to the small term overlap. While there have been
multiple proposals for dense representations of words, measuring similarity
between short texts (sentences, snippets, paragraphs) requires combining these
token level similarities. In this paper, we propose to combine ESA
representations and word2vec representations as a way to generate denser
representations and, consequently, a better similarity measure between short
texts. We study three densification mechanisms that involve aligning sparse
representation via many-to-many, many-to-one, and one-to-one mappings. We then
show the effectiveness of these mechanisms on measuring similarity between
short texts.
