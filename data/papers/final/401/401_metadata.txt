Abstract#==#This paper introduces a task of identifying and semantically classifying
lexical expressions in context. We investigate the online reviews genre, adding
semantic supersense annotations to a 55,000 word English corpus that was
previously annotated for multiword expressions. The noun and verb supersenses
apply to full lexical expressions, whether single- or multiword. We then
present a sequence tagging model that jointly infers lexical expressions and
their supersenses. Results show that even with our relatively small training
corpus in a noisy domain, the joint task can be performed to attain 70% class
labeling F1.
