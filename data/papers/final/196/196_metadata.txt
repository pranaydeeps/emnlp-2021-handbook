Abstract#==#This paper describes a joint model of word segmentation and phonological
alternations, which takes unsegmented utterances as input and infers word
segmentations and underlying phonological representations. The model is a
Maximum Entropy or log-linear model, which can express a probabilistic version
of Optimality Theory (OT; Prince 2004), a standard phonological framework. The 
features in our model are inspired by OT's Markedness and Faithfulness
constraints. Following the OT principle that such features indicate
``violations'', we require their weights to be non-positive. We apply our model
to a modified version of the Buckeye corpus (Pitt 2007) in which the only
phonological alternations are deletions of word-final /d/ and /t/ segments. 
The model sets a new state-of-the-art for this corpus for word segmentation,
identification of underlying forms, and identification of /d/ and /t/
deletions.  

We also show that the OT-inspired sign constraints on feature weights are
crucial for accurate identification of deleted /d/s; without them our model
posits approximately 10 times more deleted underlying /d/s than appear in the
manually annotated data.
