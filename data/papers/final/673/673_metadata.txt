Abstract#==#Recent work has successfully leveraged the
semantic information extracted from lexical
knowledge bases such as WordNet and
FrameNet to improve English event coreference
resolvers. The lack of comparable resources
in other languages, however, has made
the design of high-performance non-English
event coreference resolvers, particularly those
employing unsupervised models, very difficult.
We propose a generative model for the
under-studied task of Chinese event coreference
resolution that rivals its supervised counterparts
in performance when evaluated on the
ACE 2005 corpus.
