Abstract#==#Lemmatization for the Sumerian language, compared to the modern languages, is
much more challenging due to that it is a long dead language, highly skilled
language experts are extremely scarce and more and more Sumerian texts are
coming out. This paper describes how our unsupervised Sumerian named-entity
recognition (NER) system helps to improve the lemmatization of the Cuneiform
Digital Library Initiative (CDLI), a specialist database of cuneiform texts,
from the Ur III period. Experiments show that a promising improvement in
personal name annotation in such texts and a substantial reduction in expert
annotation effort can be achieved by leveraging our system with minimal seed
annotation.
