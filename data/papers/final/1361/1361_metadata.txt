Abstract#==#Math word problem solving has attracted considerable research interest in recent years.
Previous works have shown the effectiveness of utilizing graph neural networks to capture the relationships in the problem. 
However, these works did not carefully take the edge label information and the long-range word relationship across sentences into consideration.
In addition, during generation, they focus on the most relevant areas of the currently generated word, while neglecting the rest of the problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree model (EEH-G2T), in which the math word problems are represented as edge-labeled graphs.
Specifically, an edge-enhanced hierarchical graph encoder is used to incorporate edge label information. 
This encoder updates the graph nodes hierarchically in two steps: sentence-level aggregation and problem-level aggregation.
Furthermore, a tree-structured decoder with a split attention mechanism is applied to guide the model to pay attention to different parts of the input problem.
Experimental results on the MAWPS and Math23K dataset showed that our EEH-G2T can effectively improve performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
