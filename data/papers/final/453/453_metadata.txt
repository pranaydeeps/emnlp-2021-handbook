Abstract#==#It is well known that prosodic information is used by infants in early language
acquisition. In particular, prosodic boundaries have been shown to help infants
with sentence and word-level segmentation. In this study, we extend an
unsupervised method for word segmentation to include information about prosodic
boundaries. The boundary information used was either derived from oracle data
(hand-annotated), or extracted automatically with a system that employs only
acoustic cues for boundary detection. The approach was tested on two different
languages, English and Japanese, and the results show that boundary information
helps word segmentation in both cases. The performance gain obtained for two
typologically distinct languages shows the robustness of prosodic information
for word segmentation. Furthermore, the improvements are not limited to the use
of oracle information, similar performances being obtained also with
automatically extracted boundaries.
