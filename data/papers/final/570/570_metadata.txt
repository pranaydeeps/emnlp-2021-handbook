Abstract#==#We present an intuitive and effective method for inducing style scores on words
and phrases. We exploit signal in a phraseâ€™s rate of occurrence across
stylistically contrasting corpora, making our method simple to implement and
efficient to scale. We show strong results both intrinsically, by correlation
with human judgements, and extrinsically, in applications to genre analysis and
paraphrasing.
