Abstract#==#Table filling based relational triple extraction methods are attracting growing research interests due to their  promising performance and their abilities on extracting triples from complex sentences. However, this kind of methods are far from their full potential because most of them only focus on using local features  but ignore the global associations of relations and of token pairs, which increases the possibility of overlooking  some important information during triple extraction. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a global feature-oriented triple extraction model that makes full use of the mentioned two kinds of global associations. Specifically, we first generate a table feature for each relation. Then  two kinds of global associations are mined from the generated table features. Next, the mined global associations are integrated into the table feature of each relation. This ``generate-mine-integrate'' process is performed multiple times so that the table feature of each relation is refined step by step. Finally, each relation's table is filled based on its refined table feature, and all triples linked to this relation are extracted based on its filled table. We evaluate the proposed model on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show  our model is effective and it achieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets.
