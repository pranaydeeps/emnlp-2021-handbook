Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce a new approach for joint segmentation, POS tagging
and dependency parsing. While joint modeling of these tasks addresses the issue
of error propagation inherent in traditional pipeline architectures, it also
complicates the inference task. Past research has addressed this challenge by
placing constraints on the scoring function. In contrast, we propose an
approach that can handle arbitrarily complex scoring functions. Specifically,
we employ a randomized greedy algorithm that jointly predicts segmentations,
POS tags and dependency trees. Moreover, this architecture readily handles
different segmentation tasks, such as morphological segmentation for Arabic and
word segmentation for Chinese. The joint model outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems on three datasets, obtaining 2.1% TedEval absolute gain against the
best published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task.
