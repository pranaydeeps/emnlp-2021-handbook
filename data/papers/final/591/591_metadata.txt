Abstract#==#We present a new algorithm for transforming dependency parse trees into
phrase-structure parse trees. We cast the problem as struc- tured prediction
and learn a statistical model. Our algorithm is faster than traditional phrase-
structure parsing and achieves 90.4% English parsing accuracy and 82.4% Chinese
parsing accuracy, near to the state of the art on both benchmarks.
