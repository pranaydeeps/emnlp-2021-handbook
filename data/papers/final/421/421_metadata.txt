Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis has undergone a shift from
document-level analysis, where labels express
the sentiment of a whole document or whole sentence,
to subsentential approaches, which assess the
contribution of individual phrases, in particular
including the composition of sentiment terms and
phrases such as negators and intensifiers.
Starting from a small sentiment treebank modeled
after the Stanford Sentiment Treebank of
Socher et al. (2013), we investigate suitable
methods to perform compositional sentiment
classification for German in a data-scarce
setting, harnessing cross-lingual methods as well
as existing general-domain lexical resources.
