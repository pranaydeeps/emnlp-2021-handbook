Abstract#==#When training most modern reading comprehension models, all the questions associated with a context are treated as being independent from each other. However, closely related questions and their corresponding answers are not independent, and leveraging these relationships could provide a strong supervision signal to a model.  Drawing on ideas from contrastive estimation, we introduce several new supervision losses that compare question-answer scores across multiple related instances.  Specifically, we normalize these scores across various neighborhoods of closely contrasting questions and/or answers, adding a cross entropy loss term in addition to traditional maximum likelihood estimation.  Our techniques require bundles of related question-answer pairs, which we either mine from within existing data or create using automated heuristics.   We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of training with instance bundles on two datasets---HotpotQA and ROPES---showing up to 9% absolute gains in accuracy.
