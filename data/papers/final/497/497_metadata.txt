Abstract#==#More and more of the information available
on the web is dialogic, and a significant portion
of it takes place in online forum conversations
about current social and political topics.
We aim to develop tools to summarize
what these conversations are about. What are
the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS associated with
different stances on an issue; what are the abstract
objects under discussion that are central
to a speakerâ€™s argument? How can we recognize
that two CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS realize
the same FACET of the argument? We hypothesize
that the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS
are exactly those arguments that people find
most salient, and use human summarization
as a probe for discovering them. We describe
our corpus of human summaries of opinionated
dialogs, then show how we can identify
similar repeated arguments, and group them
into FACETS across many discussions of a
topic. We define a new task, ARGUMENT
FACET SIMILARITY (AFS), and show that we
can predict AFS with a .54 correlation score,
versus an ngram system baseline of .39 and
a semantic textual similarity system baseline
of .45.
