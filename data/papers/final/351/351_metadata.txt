Abstract#==#The subconscious influence of framing on perceptions of political issues is
well-document in political science and communication research. A related line
of work suggests that drawing attention to framing may help reduce such framing
effects by enabling frame reflection, critical examination of the framing
underlying an issue. However, definite guidance on how to identify framing does
not exist. This paper presents a technique for identifying frame-invoking
language. The paper first describes a human subjects pilot study that explores
how individuals identify framing and informs the design of our technique. The
paper then describes our data collection and annotation approach. Results show
that the best performing classifiers achieve performance comparable to that of
human annotators, and they indicate which aspects of language most pertain to
framing. Both technical and theoretical implications are discussed.
