Abstract#==#We study  the  problem  of  multilingual  automated  reply  suggestions  (RS)  model  serving many languages simultaneously.  Multilingual models are often challenged by model capacity and  severe  data  distribution  skew  across  languages.   While  prior  works  largely  focus  on monolingual models, we propose Conditional Generative   Matching   models   (CGM),   optimized within a Variational Autoencoder framework to address challenges arising from multilingual  RS.  CGM  does  so  with  expressive message conditional priors, mixture densities to  enhance  multilingual  data  representation, latent  alignment  for  language  discrimination, and  effective  variational  optimization  techniques for training multilingual RS. The enhancements result in performance that exceed competitive  baselines  in  relevance  (ROUGE score) by more than 10% on average, and 16%for low resource languages.  CGM also shows remarkable  improvements  in  diversity  (80%) illustrating its expressiveness in representation of multi-lingual data.
