Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate the challenging task of understanding short text
(STU task) by
jointly considering topic modeling and knowledge incorporation. 
Knowledge incorporation can solve the content sparsity problem effectively for
topic modeling. Specifically, the phrase topic model is proposed to leverage
the auto-mined knowledge, i.e., the phrases, to guide the generative process of
short text. 
Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the mechanism that
utilizes knowledge
to improve topic modelingâ€™s performance.
