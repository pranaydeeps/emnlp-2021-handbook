Abstract#==#We approach the task of morphological inflection generation as discriminative
string transduction.  Our supervised system learns to generate word-forms from
lemmas accompanied by morphological tags, and refines them by referring to the
other forms within a paradigm.              Results of experiments on six diverse
languages
with varying amounts of training data demonstrate that our approach improves
the state of the art in terms of predicting inflected word-forms.
