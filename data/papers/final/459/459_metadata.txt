Abstract#==#We present a framework for using continuous-space vector
representations of word meaning to derive new
vectors representing the meaning of senses listed in a semantic
network. It is a post-processing approach that can be applied to
several types of word vector representations. It uses two ideas: first, that
vectors
for polysemous words can be decomposed into a mix of sense
vectors; secondly, that the vector for a sense is kept
similar to those of its neighbors in the network.
This leads to a constrained optimization problem, and we present an
approximation for the case when the distance
function is the squared Euclidean.

We applied this algorithm on a Swedish semantic network, and we
evaluate the quality of the resulting sense representations
extrinsically by showing that they give large improvements 
when used in a classifier that creates lexical units for FrameNet frames.
