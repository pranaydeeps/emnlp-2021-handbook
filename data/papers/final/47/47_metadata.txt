Abstract#==#Most successful Entity Linking (EL) methods aim to link mentions to their
referent entities in a structured Knowledge Base (KB) by comparing their
respective contexts, often using similarity measures. While the KB structure is
given, current methods have suffered from impoverished information
representations on the mention side. In this paper, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013)
to select high quality sets of entity ``collaborators'' to feed a simple
similarity measure (Jaccard) to link entity mentions. Experimental results show
that AMR captures contextual properties discriminative enough to make linking
decisions, without the need for EL training data, and that system with AMR
parsing output outperforms hand labeled traditional semantic roles as context
representation for EL. Finally, we show promising preliminary results for using
AMR to select sets of ``coherent'' entity mentions for collective entity
linking.
