Abstract#==#Dialogue systems that support users in complex problem solving must interpret
user utterances within the context of a dynamically changing, user-created
problem solving artifact. This paper presents a novel approach to semantic
grounding of noun phrases within tutorial dialogue for computer programming.
Our approach performs joint segmentation and labeling of the noun phrases to
link them to attributes of entities within the problem-solving environment.
Evaluation results on a corpus of tutorial dialogue for Java programming
demonstrate that a Conditional Random Field model performs well, achieving an
accuracy of 89.3% for linking semantic segments to the correct entity
attributes. This work is a step toward enabling dialogue systems to support
users in increasingly complex problem-solving tasks.
