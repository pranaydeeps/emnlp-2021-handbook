Abstract#==#Research on entity linking has considered a broad range of text, including
newswire, blogs and web documents in multiple languages. However, the problem
of entity linking for spoken language remains unexplored. Spoken language
obtained from automatic speech recognition systems poses different types of
challenges for entity linking; transcription errors can distort the context,
and named entities tend to have high error rates. We propose features to
mitigate these errors and  evaluate the impact of ASR errors on entity linking
using a new corpus of entity linked broadcast news transcripts.
