Abstract#==#This paper gives a detailed experiment feedback of different approaches to
adapt a statistical machine translation system towards a targeted translation
project, using only small amounts of parallel in-domain data. The experiments
were performed by professional translators under realistic conditions of work
using a computer assisted translation tool. 
We analyze the influence of these adaptations on the translator productivity
and on the overall post-editing effort. We show that significant improvements
can be obtained by using the presented adaptation techniques.
