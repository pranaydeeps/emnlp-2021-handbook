Abstract#==#We address the problem of automatically aligning natural language sentences
with corresponding video segments without any direct supervision. Most existing
algorithms for integrating language with videos rely on hand-aligned parallel
data, where each natural language sentence is manually aligned with its
corresponding image or video segment. Recently, fully unsupervised alignment of
text with video has been shown to be feasible using hierarchical generative
models. In contrast to the previous generative models, we propose three
latent-variable discriminative models for the unsupervised alignment task. The
proposed discriminative models are capable of incorporating domain knowledge,
by adding diverse and overlapping features. The results show that
discriminative models outperform the generative models in terms of alignment
accuracy.
