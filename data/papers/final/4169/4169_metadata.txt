Abstract#==#Grounded dialogue models generate responses that are grounded on certain concepts. Limited by the distribution of grounded dialogue data, models trained on such data face the \textit{transferability} challenges in terms of the data distribution and the type of grounded concepts. To address the challenges, we propose the \textit{grounded minimal editing} framework, which minimally edits existing responses to be grounded on the given concept. Focusing on personas, we propose Grounded Minimal Editor (GME), which learns to edit by disentangling and recombining persona-related and persona-agnostic parts of the response. To evaluate persona-grounded minimal editing, we present the \textsc{PersonaMi-nEdit} dataset, and experimental results show that GME outperforms competitive baselines by a large margin. To evaluate the transferability, we experiment on the test set of \textsc{BlendedSkillTalk} and show that GME can edit dialogue models' responses to largely improve their persona consistency while preserving the use of knowledge and empathy.
