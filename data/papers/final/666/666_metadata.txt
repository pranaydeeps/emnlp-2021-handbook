Abstract#==#If speakers use language rationally, they should structure their messages to
achieve approximately uniform information density (UID), in order to optimize
transmission via a noisy channel. Previous work identified a consistent
increase in linguistic information across sentences in text as a signature of
the UID hypothesis. This increase was derived from a predicted increase in
context, but the context itself was not quantified. We use microblog texts from
Twitter, tied to a single shared event (the baseball World Series), to quantify
both linguistic and non-linguistic context. By tracking changes in contextual
information, we predict and identify gradual and rapid changes in information
content in response to in-game events. These findings lend further support to
the UID hypothesis and highlights the importance of non-linguistic common
ground for language production and processing.
