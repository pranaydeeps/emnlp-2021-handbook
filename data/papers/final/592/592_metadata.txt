Abstract#==#Most of the current approaches to sentiment analysis of product reviews are
dependent on lexical sentiment information and proceed in a bottom-up way,
adding new layers of features to lexical data. In this paper, we maintain that
a typical product review is not a bag of sentiments, but a narrative with an
underlying structure and reoccurring patterns, which allows us to predict its
sentiments knowing only its general polarity and discourse cues that occur in
it. We hypothesize that knowing only the reviewâ€™s score and its discourse
patterns would allow us to accurately predict the sentiments of its individual
sentences. The experiments we conducted prove this hypothesis and show a
substantial improvement over the lexical baseline.
