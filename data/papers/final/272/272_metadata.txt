Abstract#==#We present the first truly streaming cross document coreference resolution
(CDC) system. Processing infinite streams of mentions forces us to use a
constant amount of memory and so we maintain a representative, fixed sized
sample at all times. For the sample to be representative it should represent a
large number of entities whilst taking into account both temporal recency and
distant references. We introduce new sampling techniques that take into account
a notion of streaming discourse (current mentions depend on previous mentions).
Using the proposed sampling techniques we are able to get a CEAFe score within
5% of a non-streaming system while using only 30% of the memory.
