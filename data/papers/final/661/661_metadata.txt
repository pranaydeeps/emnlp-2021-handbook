Abstract#==#We describe how a question-answering system can learn about its domain from
conversational dialogs. Our system learns to relate concepts in science
questions to propositions in a fact corpus, stores new concepts and relations
in a knowledge graph (KG), and uses the graph to solve questions. We are the
first to acquire knowledge for question-answering from open, natural language
dialogs without a fixed ontology or domain model that predetermines what users
can say. Our relation-based strategies complete more successful dialogs than a
query expansion baseline, our task-driven relations are more effective for
solving science questions than relations from general knowledge sources, and
our method is practical enough to generalize to other domains.
