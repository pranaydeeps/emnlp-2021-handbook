Abstract#==#This work improves monolingual sentence alignment for text simplification,
specifically for text in standard and simple Wikipedia. We introduce a method
that improves over past efforts by using a greedy (vs. ordered) search over the
document and a word-level se- mantic similarity score based on Wiktionary (vs.
WordNet) that also accounts for structural similarity through syntactic
dependencies. Experiments show improved performance on a hand-aligned set, with
the largest gain coming from structural similarity. Resulting datasets of
manually and automatically aligned sentence pairs are made available.
