Abstract#==#We present a statistical framework to extract information-rich citation
sentences that summarise the main contributions of a scientific paper. In a
first stage, we automatically discover salient keywords from a paper's citation
summary, keywords that characterise its main contributions. In a second stage,
exploiting the results of the first stage, we identify citation sentences that
best capture the paper's main contributions. Experimental results show that our
approach using methods rooted in quantitative statistics and information theory
outperforms the current state-of-the-art systems in scientific paper
summarisation.
