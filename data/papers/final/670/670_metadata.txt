Abstract#==#Most recent unsupervised methods in vector space semantics for assessing
thematic fit (e.g. Erk, 2007;
Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Sayeed and Demberg, 2014) create prototypical
role-fillers without performing word sense disambiguation.  This leads to a
kind of sparsity problem: candidate role-fillers for different
senses of the verb end up being measured by the same “yardstick”, the
single prototypical role-filler.

In this work, we use three different feature spaces to construct robust
unsupervised models of distributional semantics. We show that correlation with
human judgements on thematic fit estimates can be improved consistently by
clustering typical role-fillers and then calculating similarities of candidate
role-fillers with these cluster centroids. The suggested methods can be used in
any vector space model that constructs a prototype vector from a non-trivial
set of typical vectors.
