Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the problem of cognate identification in NLP. We
introduce the idea of gap-weighted subsequences for discriminating cognates
from non-cognates. We also propose a scheme to integrate phonetic features into
the feature vectors for cognate identification. We show that subsequence based
features perform better than state-of-the-art classifier for the purpose of
cognate identification. The contribution of this paper is the use of
subsequence features for cognate identification.
