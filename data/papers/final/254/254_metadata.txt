Abstract#==#In this paper we study the task of movie script summarization, which we argue
could enhance script browsing, give readers a rough idea of the script's
plotline, and speed up reading time. We formalize the process of generating a
shorter version of a screenplay as the task of finding an optimal chain of
scenes. We develop a graph-based model that selects a chain by jointly
optimizing its logical progression, diversity, and importance. Human evaluation
based on a question-answering task shows that our model produces summaries
which are more informative compared to competitive baselines.
