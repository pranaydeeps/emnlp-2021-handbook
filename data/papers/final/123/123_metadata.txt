Abstract#==#Multiview LSA (MVLSA) is a generalization of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
that supports the fusion of arbitrary views of data and relies on Generalized
Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA). We present an algorithm for fast
approximate computation of GCCA, which when coupled with methods for handling
missing values, is general enough to approximate some recent algorithms for
inducing vector representations of words. Experiments across a comprehensive
collection of test-sets show our approach to be competitive with the state of
the art.
