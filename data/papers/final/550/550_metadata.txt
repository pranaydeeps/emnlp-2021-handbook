Abstract#==#We present a joint model for predicate argument alignment. We leverage multiple
sources of semantic information, including temporal ordering constraints
between events. These
are combined in a max-margin framework to find a globally consistent view of
entities and events across multiple documents, which leads to improvements on
the state-of-the-art.
