Abstract#==#While the effect of various lexical, syntactic, semantic and stylistic features
have been addressed in persuasive language from a computational point of view,
the persuasive effect of phonetics has received little attention. By modeling a
notion of euphony and analyzing four datasets comprising persuasive and
non-persuasive sentences in different domains (political speeches, movie
quotes, slogans and tweets), we explore the impact of sounds on different forms
of persuasiveness. We conduct a series of analyses and prediction experiments
within and across datasets. Our results highlight the positive role of phonetic
devices on persuasion.
