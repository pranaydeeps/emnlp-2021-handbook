Abstract#==#Linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions
(lexical, phonological, morphological, and syntactic) from a “donor”
language to a “recipient” language as a result of contacts between
communities speaking different languages. Borrowed words are found in all
languages, and—in contrast to cognate relationships—borrowing relationships
may exist across unrelated languages (for example, about 40% of Swahili’s
vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic). In this paper, we develop a model of
morpho-phonological transformations across languages with features based on
universal constraints from Optimality Theory (OT). Compared to several
standard—but linguistically naïve—baselines, our OT-inspired model obtains
good performance with only a few dozen training examples, making this a
cost-effective strategy for sharing lexical information across languages.
