Abstract#==#This paper describes Idest, a new method for learning paraphrases of event
patterns. It is based on a new neural network architecture that only relies on
the weak supervision signal that comes from the news published on the same day
and mention the same real-world entities. It can generalize across extractions
from different dates to produce a robust paraphrase model for event patterns
that can also capture meaningful representations for rare patterns. We compare
it with two state-of-the-art systems and show that it can attain comparable
quality when trained on a small dataset. Its generalization capabilities also
allow it to leverage much more data, leading to substantial quality
improvements.
