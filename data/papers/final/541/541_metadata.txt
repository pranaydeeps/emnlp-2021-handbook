Abstract#==#Topic models provide insights into document collections, and their
  supervised extensions also capture associated document level
  metadata such as sentiment. However, inferring such models from data
  is often slow and cannot scale to big data.  We build upon the
  ``anchor'' method for learning topic models to capture the
  relationship between metadata and latent topics by extending the
  vector space representation of word cooccurrence to include
  metadata specific dimensions.  These additional dimensions reveal
  new anchor words that reflect specific combinations of metadata and
  topic.  We show that these new latent representations predict
  sentiment as accurately as supervised topic models, and we find these
  representations  more quickly without sacrificing
  interpretability.
