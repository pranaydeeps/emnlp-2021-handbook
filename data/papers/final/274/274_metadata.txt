Abstract#==#We introduce a distantly supervised event ex-
traction approach that extracts complex event
templates from microblogs. We show that this
near real-time data source is more challeng-
ing than news because it contains information
that is both approximate (e.g., with values that
are close but different from the gold truth) and
ambiguous (due to the brevity of the texts),
impacting both the evaluation and extraction
methods. For the former, we propose a novel,
“soft”, F1 metric that incorporates similarity
between extracted fillers and the gold truth,
giving partial credit to different but similar
values. With respect to extraction method-
ology, we propose two extensions to the dis-
tant supervision paradigm: to address approx-
imate information, we allow positive training
examples to be generated from information
that is similar but not identical to gold values;
to address ambiguity, we aggregate contexts
across tweets discussing the same event. We
evaluate our contributions on the complex do-
main of earthquakes, with events with up to
20 arguments. Our results indicate that, de-
spite their simplicity, our contributions yield
a statistically-significant improvement of 25%
(relative) over a strong distantly-supervised
system. The dataset containing the knowledge
base, relevant tweets and manual annotations
is publicly available.
