Abstract#==#Gradable terms such as brief, lengthy and extended illustrate varying degrees
of a scale and can therefore participate in comparative constructs. Knowing the
set of words that can be compared on the same scale and the associated ordering
between them (brief < lengthy < extended) is very useful for a variety of
lexical semantic tasks. Current techniques to derive such an ordering rely on
WordNet to determine which words belong on the same scale and are limited to
adjectives. Here we describe an extension to recent work: we investigate a
fully automated pipeline to extract gradable terms from a corpus, group them
into clusters reflecting the same scale and establish an ordering among them.
This methodology reduces the amount of required handcrafted knowledge, and can
infer gradability of words independent of their part of speech. Our approach
infers an ordering for adjectives with comparable performance to previous work,
but also for adverbs with an accuracy of 71%. We find that the technique is
useful for inferring such rankings among words across different domains, and
present an example using biomedical text.
