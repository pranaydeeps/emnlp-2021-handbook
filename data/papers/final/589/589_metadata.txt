Abstract#==#Some state-of-the-art summarization systems use integer linear programming
(ILP) based methods that aim to maximize the important concepts covered in the
summary. These concepts are often obtained by selecting bigrams from the
documents. In this paper, we improve such bigram based ILP summarization
methods from different aspects. First we use syntactic information to select
more important bigrams. Second, to estimate the importance of the bigrams, in
addition to the internal features based on the test documents (e.g., document
frequency, bigram positions), we propose to extract features by leveraging
multiple external resources (such as word embedding from additional
corpus,Wikipedia, Dbpedia,Word-Net, SentiWordNet). The bigram weights are then
trained discriminatively in a joint learning model that predicts the bigram
weights and selects the summary sentences in the ILP framework at the same
time. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the prior ILP
method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to other
previously reported best results. We also conducted various analysis to show
the contribution of different components.
