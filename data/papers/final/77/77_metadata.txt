Abstract#==#Developing a system that can automatically respond to a user's utterance has
recently become a topic of research in natural language processing. However,
most works on the topic take into account only a single preceding utterance to
generate a response. Recent works demonstrate that the application of
statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques towards monolingual dialogue
setting, in which a response is treated as a translation of a stimulus, has a
great potential, and we exploit the approach to tackle the context-dependent
response generation task. We attempt to extract relevant and significant
information from the wider contextual scope of the conversation, and
incorporate it into the SMT techniques. We also discuss the advantages and
limitations of this approach through our experimental results.
