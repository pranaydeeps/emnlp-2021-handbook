Abstract#==#Inferring latent attributes of online users has many applications in
public health, politics, and marketing. Most existing approaches rely on
supervised learning algorithms, which require manual data annotation
and therefore are costly to develop and adapt over time. In this paper, we
propose a lightly supervised approach based on label regularization to infer
the age, ethnicity, and political orientation of Twitter users. Our approach
learns from a heterogeneous collection of soft constraints derived from Census
demographics, trends in baby names, and Twitter accounts that are emblematic
of class labels. To counteract the imprecision of such constraints, we compare
several constraint selection algorithms that optimize classification accuracy
on a tuning set. We find that using no user-annotated data, our approach is
within 2% of a fully supervised baseline for three of four tasks. Using a
small set of labeled data for tuning further improves accuracy on all tasks.
