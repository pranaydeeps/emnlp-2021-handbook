Abstract#==#One of the most challenging aspects of current single-document news summarization
is that the summary often contains `extrinsic hallucinations', i.e., facts that are not present in the source document, which are often derived via world knowledge.
This causes summarisation systems to act more like open-ended language models tending to hallucinate facts that are erroneous.
In this paper, we mitigate this problem with the help of multiple supplementary resource documents assisting the task.
We present a new dataset MiraNews and benchmark existing summarisation models. 
In contrast to multi-document summarization, which addresses multiple events from several source documents, we still aim at generating a summary for a single document.
We show via data analysis that it's not only the models which are to blame: more than 27% of facts mentioned in the gold summaries of MiraNews are better grounded on assisting documents than in the main source articles. 
An error analysis of generated summaries from pretrained models fine-tuned on MIRANEWS  reveals that this has an even bigger effects on models:
assisted summarisation reduces 55% of  hallucinations when compared to single-document summarisation models trained on the main article only.
