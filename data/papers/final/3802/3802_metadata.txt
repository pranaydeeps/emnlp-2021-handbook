Abstract#==#We present ReasonBert, a pre-training method that augments language models with the ability to reason over long-range relations and multiple, possibly hybrid contexts.  Unlike existing pre-training methods that only harvest learning signals from local contexts of naturally occurring texts, we propose a generalized notion of distant supervision to automatically connect multiple pieces of text and tables to create pre-training examples that require long-range reasoning.  Different types of reasoning are simulated,  including intersecting multiple pieces of evidence,  bridging from one piece of evidence to another, and detecting unanswerable cases.   We conduct a  comprehensive evaluation on a variety of extractive question answering datasets ranging from single-hop to multi-hop and from text-only to table-only to hybrid that require various reasoning capabilities and show that  ReasonBert achieves remarkable improvement over an array of strong baselines.   Few-shot experiments further demonstrate that our pre-training method substantially improves sample efficiency.
