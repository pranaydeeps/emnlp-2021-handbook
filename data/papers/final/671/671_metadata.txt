Abstract#==#Machine transliteration is often referred to as phonetic translation.
We show that transliterations incorporate information from both
spelling and pronunciation, and propose an effective model for joint
transliteration generation from both representations. We further
generalize this model to include transliterations from other
languages, and enhance it with re-ranking and lexicon features. We
demonstrate substantial improvements in transliteration accuracy on
several datasets.
