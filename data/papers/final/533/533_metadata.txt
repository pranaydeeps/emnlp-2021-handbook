Abstract#==#Text documents of varying nature (e.g., summary documents written by analysts
or published, scientific papers) often cite others as a means of providing
evidence to support a claim, attributing credit, or referring the reader to
related work. We address the problem of predicting a document's cited sources
by introducing a novel, discriminative approach which combines a content-based
generative model (LDA) with author-based features. Further, our classifier is
able to learn the importance and quality of each topic within our corpus --
which can be useful beyond this task -- and preliminary results suggest its
metric is competitive with other standard metrics (Topic Coherence). Our
flagship system, Logit-Expanded, provides state-of-the-art performance on the
largest corpus ever used for this task.
