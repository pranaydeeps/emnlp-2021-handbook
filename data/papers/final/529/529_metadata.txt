Abstract#==#Named entity recognition (NER) systems trained on newswire perform very badly
when tested on Twitter. Signals that were reliable in copy-edited text
disappear almost entirely in Twitter's informal chatter, requiring the
construction of specialized models. Using well-understood techniques, we set
out to improve Twitter NER performance when given a small set of annotated
training tweets. To leverage unlabeled tweets, we build Brown clusters and word
vectors, enabling generalizations across distributionally similar words. To
leverage annotated newswire data, we employ an importance weighting scheme.
Taken all together, we establish a new state-of-the-art on two common test
sets. Though it is well-known that word representations are useful for NER,
supporting experiments have thus far focused on newswire data. We emphasize the
effectiveness of representations on Twitter NER, and demonstrate that their
inclusion can improve performance by up to 20 F1.
