Abstract#==#Analyzing microblogs where we post what we experience enables us to perform various applications such as social-trend analysis and entity recommendation.
To track emerging trends in a variety of areas, we want to categorize information on emerging entities (e.g., Avatar 2) in microblog posts according to their types (e.g., Film).
We thus introduce a new entity typing task that assigns a fine-grained type to each emerging entity when a burst of posts containing that entity is first observed in a microblog.
The challenge is to perform typing from noisy microblog posts without relying on prior knowledge of the target entity.
To tackle this task, we build large-scale Twitter datasets for English and Japanese using time-sensitive distant supervision.
We then propose a modular neural typing model that encodes not only the entity and its contexts but also meta information in multiple posts. 
To type `homographic' emerging entities (e.g., `Go' means an emerging programming language and a classic board game), which contexts are noisy, we devise a context selector that finds related contexts of the target entity.
Experiments on the Twitter datasets confirm the effectiveness of our typing model and the context selector.
