Abstract#==#We present a new deep learning architecture Bi-CNN-MI for paraphrase
identification (PI). Based on the insight that PI requires comparing two
sentences on multiple levels of granularity, we learn multigranular sentence
representations using convolutional neural network (CNN) and model interaction
features at each level. These
features are then the input to a logistic classifier for
PI. All parameters of the model (for embeddings, convolution
and classification) are directly optimized for PI. To
address the lack of training data, we pretrain the network
in a novel way using a language modeling task. 
Results on the MSRP corpus surpass that of previous NN competitors.
