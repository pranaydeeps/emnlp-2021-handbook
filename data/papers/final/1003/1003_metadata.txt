Abstract#==#This paper focuses on paraphrase generation,which is a widely studied natural language generation task in NLP. With the development of neural models, paraphrase generation research has  exhibited  a  gradual  shift  to  neural  methods  in  the  recent  years.    This  has  provided architectures for contextualized representation of an input text and generating fluent, diverseand human-like paraphrases.   This paper surveys various approaches to paraphrase generation with a main focus on neural methods.
