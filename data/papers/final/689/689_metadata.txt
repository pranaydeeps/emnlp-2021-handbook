Abstract#==#We present a discriminative model for detecting
disfluencies in spoken language transcripts.
Structurally, our model is a semi-Markov
conditional random field with features
targeting characteristics unique to speech repairs.
This gives a significant performance
improvement over standard chain-structured
CRFs that have been employed in past work.
We then incorporate prosodic features over
silences and relative word duration into our
semi-CRF model, resulting in further performance
gains; moreover, these features are not
easily replaced by discrete prosodic indicators
such as ToBI breaks. Our final system,
the semi-CRF with prosodic information,
achieves an F-score of 85.4, which is 1.3 F1
better than the best prior reported F-score on
this dataset.
