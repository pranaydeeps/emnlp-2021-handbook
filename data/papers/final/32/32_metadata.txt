Abstract#==#A portmanteau is a type of compound word that fuses the sounds and meanings of
two component words; for example, “frenemy” (friend + enemy) or “smog”
(smoke + fog). We develop a system, including a novel multitape FST, that takes
an input of two words and outputs possible portmanteaux. Our system is trained
on a list of known portmanteaux and their component words, and achieves 45%
exact matches in cross-validated experiments.
