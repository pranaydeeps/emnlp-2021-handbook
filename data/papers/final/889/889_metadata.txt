Abstract#==#Spoken dialogue systems need to be able to handle both multiple languages and multilinguality inside a conversation (\textit{e.g} in case of code-switching). In this work, we introduce new pretraining losses tailored to learn generic multilingual spoken dialogue representations. The goal of these losses is to expose the model to code-switched language. In order to scale up training, we automatically build a pretraining corpus composed of multilingual conversations in five different languages (French, Italian, English, German and Spanish) from \texttt{OpenSubtitles}, a huge multilingual corpus composed of 24.3G tokens. We test the generic representations on \texttt{MIAM}, a new benchmark composed of five dialogue act corpora on the same aforementioned languages as well as on two novel multilingual tasks (\textit{i.e} multilingual mask utterance retrieval and multilingual inconsistency identification). Our experiments show that our new losses achieve a better performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings.
