Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel technique for empty category (EC) detection using
distributed word representations. We formulate it as an annotation task. We
explore the hidden layer of a neural network by mapping both the distributed
representations of the contexts of ECs and EC types to a low dimensional space.
In the testing phase, using the model learned from annotated data, we project
the context of a possible EC position to the same space and further compare it
with the representations of EC types. The closet EC type is assigned to the
candidate position. Experiments on Chinese Treebank prove the effectiveness of
the proposed method. We improve the precision by about 6 point on a subset of
Chinese Treebank, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on CTB.
