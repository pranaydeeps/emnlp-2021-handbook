Abstract#==#We propose the use of neural networks to model source-side preordering for
faster and better statistical machine translation. The neural network trains a
logistic regression model to predict whether two sibling nodes of the
source-side parse tree should be swapped in order to obtain a more monotonic
parallel corpus, based on samples extracted from the word-aligned parallel
corpus.  For multiple language pairs and domains, we show that this yields the
best reordering performance against other state-of-the-art techniques,
resulting in improved translation quality and very fast decoding.
