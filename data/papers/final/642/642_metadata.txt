Abstract#==#Our research aims to extract information about 
  medication use from veterinary discussion forums. 
  We introduce the task of categorizing information 
  about medication use to determine whether a
  doctor has prescribed medication, changed protocols,
  observed effects, or stopped use of a medication.
  First, we create a medication detector for informal 
  veterinary texts and show that features derived from 
  the Web can be very powerful. Second, we create classifiers 
  to categorize each medication mention with respect to 
  six categories.  We demonstrate that this task benefits 
  from a rich linguistic feature set, domain-specific semantic
  features produced by a weakly supervised semantic tagger, and
  balanced self-training.
