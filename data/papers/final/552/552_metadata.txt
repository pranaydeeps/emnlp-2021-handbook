Abstract#==#Tree trimming is the problem of extracting an optimal subtree from an input
 tree, and sentence extraction and sentence compression methods can be
 formulated and solved as tree trimming problems. Previous approaches
 require integer linear programming (ILP) solvers to obtain exact solutions.
 The problem of this approach is that ILP solvers are black-boxes and have
 no theoretical guarantee as to their computation complexity.  We propose a
 dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for tree trimming problems whose running
 time is O(NL log N), where N is the number of tree nodes and L
 is the length limit.  Our algorithm exploits the zero-suppressed binary
 decision diagram (ZDD), a data structure that represents a family of sets
 as a directed acyclic graph, to represent the set of subtrees in a compact
 form; the structure of ZDD permits the application of DP to obtain
 exact solutions, and our algorithm is applicable to different tree trimming
 problems.  Moreover, experiments show that our algorithm is faster than
 state-of-the-art ILP solvers, and that it scales well to handle large
 summarization problems.
