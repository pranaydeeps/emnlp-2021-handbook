Abstract#==#Research on ranked retrieval of spoken content has assumed the existence of
some automated (word or phonetic) transcription. Recently, however, methods
have been demonstrated for matching spoken terms to spoken content without the
need for language-tuned transcription. This paper describes the first
application of such techniques to ranked retrieval, evaluated using a newly
created test collection. Both the queries and the collection to be searched are
based on Gujarati produced naturally by native speakers; relevance assessment
was performed by other native speakers of Gujarati. Ranked retrieval is based
on fast acoustic matching that identifies a deeply nested set of matching
speech regions, coupled with ways of combining evidence from those matching
regions. Results indicate that the resulting ranked lists may be useful for
some practical similarity-based ranking tasks.
