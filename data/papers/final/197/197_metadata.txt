Abstract#==#An acid test for any new Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm is its
performance against the Most Frequent Sense (MFS). The field of WSD has found
the MFS baseline very hard to beat. Clearly, if WSD researchers had access to
MFS values, their striving to better this heuristic will push the WSD frontier.
However, getting MFS values requires sense marked corpus in enormous amount,
which is out of bounds for most languages, even if their WordNets are
available. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for MFS detection
from the untagged corpora, which exploits word embeddings. \textit{We compare
the word embeddings of a word with all its sense embeddings and obtain the
predominant sense with the highest similarity.} We observe significant
performance gain for Hindi WSD over the WordNet First Sense (WFS) baseline. As
for English, the SemCor baseline is bettered for those words whose frequency is
greater than 2. Our approach is language and domain independent.
