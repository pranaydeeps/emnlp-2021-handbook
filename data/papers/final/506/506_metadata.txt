Abstract#==#User-generated passwords tend to be memorable, but not secure.                       
  A
random,
computer-generated 60-bit string is much more secure.  However, users cannot
memorize random 60-bit strings.  In this paper, we investigate methods for
converting arbitrary bit strings into English word sequences (both prose and
poetry), and we study their memorability and other properties.
