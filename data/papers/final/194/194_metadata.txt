Abstract#==#Current NLP datasets targeting ambiguity can be solved by a native speaker with relative ease.
We present Cryptonite, a large-scale dataset based on cryptic crosswords, which is both linguistically complex and naturally sourced.
Each example in Cryptonite is a cryptic clue, a short phrase or sentence with a misleading surface reading, whose solving requires disambiguating semantic, syntactic, and phonetic wordplays, as well as world knowledge.
Cryptic clues pose a challenge even for experienced solvers, though top-tier experts can solve them with almost 100% accuracy.
Cryptonite is a challenging task for current models; fine-tuning T5-Large on 470k cryptic clues achieves only 7.6% accuracy, on par with the accuracy of a rule-based clue solver (8.6%).
