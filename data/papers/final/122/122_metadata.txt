Abstract#==#We present a multi-task learning approach that jointly trains 
three word alignment models over disjoint bitexts of three languages 
- source, target and pivot.
Our approach builds upon model triangulation, following Wang et
al., which approximates a source-target model 
by combining source-pivot and pivot-target models.
We develop a MAP-EM algorithm that uses triangulation as a prior, 
and show how to extend it to a multi-task setting.
On a low-resource Czech-English corpus, using French as the pivot, 
our multi-task learning approach more than doubles the gains 
in both F- and BLEU scores compared to the interpolation approach of Wang et
al.
Further experiments reveal that the choice of pivot language does not
significantly effect performance.
