Abstract#==#Citation sentences (citances) to a reference ar- ticle have been extensively
studied for sum- marization tasks. However, citances might not accurately
represent the content of the cited article, as they often fail to capture the
con- text of the reported findings and can be af- fected by epistemic value
drift. Following the intuition behind the TAC (Text Analysis Conference) 2014
Biomedical Summarization track, we propose a system that identifies text spans
in the reference article that are related to a given citance. We refer to this
problem as citance-reference spans matching. We ap- proach the problem as a
retrieval task; in this paper, we detail a comparison of different ci- tance
reformulation methods and their combi- nations. While our results show
improvement over the baseline (up to 25.9%), their absolute magnitude implies
that there is ample room for future improvement.
