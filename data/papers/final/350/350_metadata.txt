Abstract#==#A major opportunity for NLP to have a real-world impact is in helping educators
score student writing, particularly content-based writing (i.e., the task of
automated short answer scoring).  A major challenge in this enterprise is that
scored responses to a particular question (i.e., labeled data) are valuable for
modeling but limited in quantity.  Additional information from the scoring
guidelines for humans, such as exemplars for each score level and descriptions
of key concepts, can also be used.  Here, we explore methods for integrating
scoring guidelines and labeled responses, and we find that stacked
generalization (Wolpert, 1992) improves performance, especially for
small training sets.
