Abstract#==#Categories such as ANIMAL or FURNITURE
are acquired at an early age and play an important role in processing,
organizing, and conveying world knowledge. Theories of categorization largely
agree that categories are
characterized by features such as function
or appearance and that feature and category
acquisition go hand-in-hand, however previous work has considered these
problems in
isolation. We present the first model that
jointly learns categories and their features.
The set of features is shared across categories,
and strength of association is inferred in a
Bayesian framework. We approximate the
learning environment with natural language
text which allows us to evaluate performance
on a large scale. Compared to highly engineered pattern-based approaches, our
model
is cognitively motivated, knowledge-lean, and
learns categories and features which are perceived by humans as more
meaningful.
