Abstract#==#Word embedding is essential for neural network models for various natural language processing tasks.
Since the word embedding usually has a considerable size, in order to deploy a neural network model having it on edge devices, it should be effectively compressed.
There was a study for proposing a block-wise low-rank approximation method for word embedding, called GroupReduce.
Even if their structure is effective, the properties behind the concept of the block-wise word embedding compression were not sufficiently explored.
Motivated by this, we improve GroupReduce in terms of word weighting and structuring.
For word weighting, we propose a simple yet effective method inspired by the term frequency-inverse document frequency method and 
a novel differentiable method.
Based on them, we construct a discriminative word embedding compression algorithm.
In the experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm more effectively finds word weights than competitors in most cases.
In addition, we show that the proposed algorithm can act like a framework through successful cooperation with quantization.
