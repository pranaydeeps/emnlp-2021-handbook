Abstract#==#A key challenge of designing coherent semantic ontology for spoken language
understanding is to consider inter-slot relations. In practice, however, it is
difficult for domain experts and professional annotators to define a coherent
slot set, while considering various lexical, syntactic, and semantic
dependencies. In this paper, we exploit the typed syntactic dependency theory
for unsupervised induction and filling of semantics slots in spoken dialogue
systems. More specifically, we build two knowledge graphs: a slot-based
semantic graph, and a word-based lexical graph. To jointly consider
word-to-word, word-to-slot, and slot-to-slot relations, we use a random walk
inference algorithm to combine the two knowledge graphs, guided by dependency
grammars. The experiments show that considering inter-slot relations is crucial
for generating a more coherent and compete slot set, resulting in a better
spoken language understanding model, while enhancing the interpretability of
semantic slots.
