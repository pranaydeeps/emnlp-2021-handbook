Abstract#==#Content analysis, a widely-applied social science research method, is
increasingly being supplemented by topic modeling. However, while the discourse
on content analysis centers heavily on reproducibility, computer scientists
often focus more on scalability and less on coding reliability, leading to
growing skepticism on the usefulness of topic models for automated content
analysis. In response, we introduce TopicCheck, an interactive tool for
assessing topic model stability. Our contributions are threefold. First, from
established guidelines on reproducible content analysis, we distill a set of
design requirements on how to computationally assess the stability of an
automated coding process. Second, we devise an interactive alignment algorithm
for matching latent topics from multiple models, and enable sensitivity
evaluation across a large number of models. Finally, we demonstrate that our
tool enables social scientists to gain novel insights into three active
research questions.
