Abstract#==#We present a novel approach for relation classification, using a recursive
neural network (RNN), based on the shortest path between two entities in a
dependency graph. Previous works on RNN are based on constituency-based parsing
because phrasal nodes in a parse tree can capture compositionality in a
sentence. Compared with constituency-based parse trees, dependency graphs can
represent relations more compactly. This is particularly important in sentences
with distant entities, where the parse tree spans words that are not relevant
to the relation. In such cases RNN cannot be trained effectively in a timely
manner. However, due to the lack of phrasal nodes in dependency graphs,
application of RNN is not straightforward. In order to tackle this problem, we
utilize dependency constituent units called chains. Our experiments on two
relation classification datasets show that Chain based RNN provides a shallower
network, which performs considerably faster and achieves better classification
results.
