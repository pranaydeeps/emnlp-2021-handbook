Abstract#==#We present a comparative investigation of word representations for
part-of-speech
and morphological tagging, focusing on scenarios with considerable differences
between
training and test data where a robust approach is necessary. Instead of
adapting the model
towards a specific domain we aim to build a robust model across domains. We
developed
a test suite for robust tagging consisting of six languages and different
domains. We find that representations similar to Brown clusters perform best
for POS tagging and that word representations based on linguistic morphological
analyzers perform best for morphological tagging.
