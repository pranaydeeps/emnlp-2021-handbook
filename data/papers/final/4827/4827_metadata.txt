Abstract#==#This survey/position paper discusses ways to improve coverage of resources such as WordNet.
Rapp estimated correlations, rho,
between corpus statistics
and pyscholinguistic norms.  rho improves with quantity (corpus size) and quality (balance).
1M words is enough for simple estimates (unigram frequencies), but at least 100x more
is required for good estimates of word associations and embeddings. 
Given such estimates, WordNet's coverage is remarkable.  WordNet was developed on SemCor, a small  sample (200k words) 
from the Brown Corpus.  Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) attempts
to learn missing links from subsets.  But Rapp's estimates of sizes suggest it would
be more profitable to collect more data than to infer missing information that is not there.
