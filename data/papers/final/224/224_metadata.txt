Abstract#==#LR parsing is a popular parsing strategy for variants of Context-Free Grammar
(CFG). It has also been used for mildly context-sensitive formalisms, such as
Tree-Adjoining Grammar. In this paper, we present the first LR-style parsing
algorithm for Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), a mildly
context-sensitive extension of CFG which has received considerable attention in
the last years.
