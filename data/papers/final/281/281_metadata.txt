Abstract#==#We introduce the challenge of detecting semantically compatible words, that is,
words that can potentially refer to the same thing (cat and hindrance are
compatible, cat and dog are not), arguing for its central role in many semantic
tasks. We present a publicly available data-set of human compatibility ratings,
and a neural-network model that takes distributional embeddings of words
as input and learns alternative embeddings that perform the compatibility
detection task quite well.
