Abstract#==#Homomorphic encryption (HE) and garbled circuit (GC) provide the protection for users' privacy. However, simply mixing the HE and GC in RNN models suffer from long inference latency due to slow activation functions. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid structure of HE and GC gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, \cryptogru, for low-latency secure inferences. \cryptogru replaces computationally expensive GC-based $tanh$ with fast GC-based $ReLU$, and then quantizes $sigmoid$ and $ReLU$ to smaller bit-length to accelerate activations in a GRU. We evaluate \cryptogru with multiple GRU models trained on 4 public datasets. Experimental results show \cryptogru achieves top-notch accuracy and improves the secure inference latency by up to $138\times$ over one of the state-of-the-art secure networks on the Penn Treebank dataset.
