Abstract#==#Context representations are a key element in distributional models of word
meaning.
In contrast to typical representations based on neighboring words, a recently
proposed approach suggests to represent a context of a target word by a
substitute vector, comprising the potential fillers for the target word slot in
that context.
In this work we first propose a variant of substitute vectors, which we find
particularly suitable for measuring context similarity.
Then, we propose a novel model for representing word meaning in context based
on this context representation.
Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results on lexical substitution tasks in
an unsupervised setting.
