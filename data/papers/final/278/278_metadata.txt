Abstract#==#Automatic headline generation is a sub-task of document summarization with many
reported applications. In this study we present a sequence-prediction technique
for learning how editors title their news stories. The introduced technique
models the problem as a discrete optimization task in a feature-rich space. In
this space the global optimum can be found in polynomial time by means of
dynamic programming. We train and test our model on an extensive corpus of
financial news, and compare it against a number of baselines by using standard
metrics from the document summarization domain, as well as some new ones
proposed in this work. We also assess the readability and informativeness of
the generated titles through human evaluation. The obtained results are very
appealing and substantiate the soundness of the approach.
