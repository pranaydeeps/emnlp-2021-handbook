Abstract#==#Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based summarization methods have been widely
adopted recently because of their state-of-the-art performance. This paper
proposes two new modifications in this framework for update summarization. Our
key idea is to use discriminative models with a set of features to measure both
the salience and the novelty of words and sentences. First, these features are
used in a supervised model to predict the weights of the concepts used in the
ILP model. Second, we generate preliminary sentence candidates in the ILP model
and then rerank them using sentence level features. We evaluate our method on
different TAC update summarization data sets, and the results show that our
system performs competitively compared to the best TAC systems based on the
ROUGE evaluation metric.
