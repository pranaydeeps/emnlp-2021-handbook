Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce a new embedding-based metric relying on trainable ranking models to evaluate the semantic accuracy of neural data-to-text generators.
This metric is especially well suited to semantically and factually assess the performance of a text generator when tables can be associated with multiple references and table values contain textual utterances.
We first present how one can implement and further specialize the metric by training the underlying ranking models on a legal Data-to-Text dataset.
We show how it may provide a more robust evaluation than other evaluation schemes in challenging settings using a dataset comprising paraphrases between the table values and their respective references.
Finally, we evaluate its generalization capabilities on a well-known dataset, WebNLG, by comparing it with human evaluation and a recently introduced metric based on natural language inference.
We then illustrate how it naturally characterizes, both quantitatively and qualitatively, omissions and hallucinations.
