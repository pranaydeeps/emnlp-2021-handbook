Abstract#==#Automatic fact-checking is crucial for recognizing misinformation spreading on the internet.
Most existing fact-checkers break down the process into several subtasks, one of which determines candidate evidence sentences that can potentially support or refute the claim to be verified;
typically, evidence sentences with gold-standard labels are needed for this. In a more realistic setting, however, such sentence-level annotations are not available.
In this paper, we tackle the natural language inference (NLI) subtask---given a document and a (sentence) claim, determine whether the document supports or refutes the claim---only using document-level annotations. 
Using fine-tuned BERT and multiple instance learning, we achieve 81.9% accuracy, significantly outperforming the existing results on the WikiFactCheck-English dataset.
