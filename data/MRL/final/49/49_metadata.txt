Abstract#==#Dense retrieval has shown great success for passage ranking in English.
However, its effectiveness for non-English languages remains unexplored due to limitation in training resources.
In this work, we explore different transfer techniques for document ranking from English annotations to non-English languages.
Our experiments reveal that zero-shot model-based transfer using mBERT improves search quality. 
We find that weakly-supervised target language transfer is competitive compared to generation-based target language transfer, which requires translation models.
