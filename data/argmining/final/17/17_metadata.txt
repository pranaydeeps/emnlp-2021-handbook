Abstract#==#Automatic generation of arguments is an important task that can be useful for
many applications. For instance, the ability to generate coherent arguments
during a debate can be useful when determining strengths of supporting
evidence. However, with limited technologies that automatically generate
arguments, the development of computational models for debates, as well as
other areas, is becoming increasingly important. For this task, we focused on a
promising argumentation model: the Toulmin model. The Toulmin model is both
well-structured and general, and has been shown to be useful for policy
debates. In this preliminary work we attempted to generate, with a given topic
motion keyword or phrase, Toulmin model arguments by developing a computational
model for detecting arguments spanned across multiple documents. This paper
discusses our subjective results, observations, and future work.
