Abstract#==#Argument extraction is the task of identifying arguments, along with their
components in text. Arguments can be usually decomposed into a claim and one
or more premises justifying it. The proposed approach tries to identify
segments that represent argument elements (claims and premises) on social Web
texts (mainly news and blogs) in the Greek language, for a small set of
thematic domains, including articles on politics, economics, culture,
various social issues, and sports. The proposed approach exploits distributed
representations of words, extracted from a large non-annotated corpus. Among
the novel aspects of this work is the thematic domain itself which relates to
social Web, in contrast to traditional research in the area, which
concentrates mainly on law documents and scientific publications. The huge
increase of social web communities, along with their user tendency to debate,
makes the identification of arguments in these texts a necessity. In
addition, a new manually annotated corpus has been constructed that can be
used freely for research purposes. Evaluation results are quite promising,
suggesting that distributed representations can contribute positively to the
task of argument extraction.
