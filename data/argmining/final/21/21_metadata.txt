Abstract#==#Park and Cardie (2014) proposed a novel task of automatically identifying
appropriate types of support for propositions comprising online user comments,
as an essential step toward automated analysis of the adequacy of supporting
information. While multiclass Support Vector Machines (SVMs) proved to work
reasonably well, they do not exploit the sequential nature of the problem: For
instance, verifiable experiential propositions tend to appear together, because
a personal narrative typically spans multiple propositions. According to our
experiments, however, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) degrade the overall
performance, and we discuss potential fixes to this problem. Nonetheless, we
observe that the F1 score with respect to the unverifiable proposition class is
increased. Also, semi-supervised CRFs with posterior regularization trained on
75% labeled training data can closely match the performance of a supervised CRF
trained on the same training data with the remaining 25% labeled as well.
