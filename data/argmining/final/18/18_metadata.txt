Abstract#==#Online debates sparkle argumentative discussions from which generally accepted
arguments often emerge. We consider the task of unsupervised identification of
prominent argument in online debates. As a first step, in this paper we perform
a cluster analysis using semantic textual similarity to detect similar
arguments. We perform a preliminary cluster evaluation and error analysis based
on cluster-class matching against a manually labeled dataset.
