Abstract#==#Argumentation mining and stance classification were recently introduced as
interesting tasks in text mining. In this paper, a novel framework for argument
tagging based on topic modeling is proposed. Unlike other machine learning
approaches for argument tagging which often require large set of labeled data,
the proposed model is minimally supervised and merely a one-to-one mapping
between the pre-defined argument set and the extracted topics is required.
These extracted arguments are subsequently  exploited for stance
classification.  Additionally, a manually-annotated corpus for stance
classification and argument tagging of online news comments is introduced and
made available. Experiments on our collected corpus demonstrate the benefits of
using topic-modeling for argument tagging. We show that using Non-Negative
Matrix Factorization instead of Latent Dirichlet Allocation achieves better
results for argument classification, close to the results of a supervised
classifier. Furthermore, the statistical model that leverages
automatically-extracted arguments as features for stance classification shows
promising results.
