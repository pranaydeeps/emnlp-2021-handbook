Abstract#==#We investigate the characteristics of factual and emotional argumentation
styles observed in online debates. Using an annotated set of FACTUAL and
FEELING debate forum posts, we extract patterns that are highly correlated with
factual and emotional arguments, and then apply a bootstrapping methodology to
find new patterns in a larger pool of unannotated forum posts. This process
automatically produces a large set of patterns representing linguistic
expressions that are highly correlated with factual and emotional language.
Finally, we analyze the most discriminating patterns to better understand the
defining characteristics of factual and emotional arguments.
