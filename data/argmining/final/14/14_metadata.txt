Abstract#==#In this paper, we look at three different methods of extracting the
argumentative structure from a piece of natural language text. These methods
cover linguistic features, changes in the topic being discussed and a
supervised machine learning approach to identify the components of
argumentation schemes, patterns of human reasoning which have been detailed
extensively in philosophy and psychology. For each of these approaches we
achieve results comparable to those previously reported, whilst at the same
time achieving a more detailed argument structure. Finally, we use the results
from these individual techniques to apply them in combination, further
improving the argument structure identification.
