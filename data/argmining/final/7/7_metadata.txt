Abstract#==#We propose a sentence ordering method to help compose persuasive opinions for
debating. In debate texts, support of an opinion such as evidence and reason
typically follows the main claim. We focused on this claim-support structure to
order sentences, and developed a two-step method. First, we select from among
candidate sentences a first sentence that is likely to be a claim. Second, we
order the remaining sentences by using a ranking-based method. We tested the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with a general-purpose
method of sentence ordering and found through experiment that it improves the
accuracy of first sentence selection by about 19 percentage points and had a
superior performance over all metrics. We also applied the proposed method to a
constructive speech generation task.
