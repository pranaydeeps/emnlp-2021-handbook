Abstract#==#We advocate a relation based approach to Argumentation Mining. Our focus lies
on the extraction of argumentative relations instead of the identification of
arguments, themselves. By classifying pairs of sentences according to the
relation that holds between them we are able to identify sentences that may be
factual when considered in isolation, but carry argumentative meaning when read
in context. We describe scenarios in which this is useful, as well as a corpus
of annotated sentence pairs we are developing to provide a testbed for this
approach.
