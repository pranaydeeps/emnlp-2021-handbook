Abstract#==#Argumentation mining obviously involves finding support relations between
statements, but many interesting instances of argumentation also contain
counter-considerations, which the author mentions in order to preempt possible
objections by the readers. A counter-consideration in monologue text thus
involves a switch of perspective toward an imaginary „opponent“. We present
a classification approach to classifying counter-considerations and apply it to
two different corpora: a selection of very short argumentative texts produced
in a text generation experiment, and a set of newspaper commentaries. As
expected, the latter pose more difficulties, which we investigate in a brief
error anaylsis.
