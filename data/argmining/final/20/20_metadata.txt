Abstract#==#This paper proposes a shared task for the identification of the argumentative
structure in newspaper editorials. By the term “argumentative structure” we
refer to the sequence of argumentative units in the text along with the
relations between them. The main contribution is a large-scale dataset with
more than 200 annotated editorials, which shall help argumentation mining
researchers to evaluate and compare their systems in a standardized manner. The
paper details how we model and manually identify argumentative structures in
order to build this evaluation resource. Altogether, we consider the proposed
task as a constructive step towards improving writing assistance systems and
debating technologies.
