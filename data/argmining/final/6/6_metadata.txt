Abstract#==#This paper presents preliminary work on identification of argumentation
schemes, i.e., identifying premises, conclusion and name of argumentation
scheme, in arguments for scientific claims in genetics research articles. The
goal is to develop annotation guidelines for creating corpora for argumentation
mining research. This paper gives the specification of ten semantically
distinct argumentation schemes based on analysis of argumentation in several
journal articles. In addition, it presents an empirical study on readersâ€™
ability to recognize some of the argumentation schemes.
