Abstract#==#Argument mining studies in natural language text often use lexical (e.g.
n-grams) and syntactic (e.g. grammatical production rules) features with all
possible values. In prior work on a corpus of academic essays, we demonstrated
that such large and sparse feature spaces can cause difficulty for feature
selection and proposed a method to design a more compact feature space. The
proposed feature design is based on post-processing a topic model to extract
argument and domain words. In this paper we investigate the generality of this
approach, by applying our methodology to a new corpus of persuasive essays. Our
experiments show that replacing  n-grams and syntactic rules with features and
constraints using extracted  argument and domain words significantly improves
argument mining performance for persuasive essays.
