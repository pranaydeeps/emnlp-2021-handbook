Abstract#==#In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to word sense disambiguation
based on evolutionary game theory. In our algorithm each word to be
disambiguated is represented as a node on a graph and each sense as a class.
The algorithm performs a consistent class assignment of senses according to the
similarity information of each word with the others, so that similar words are
constrained to similar classes. The dynamics of the system are formulated in
terms of a non cooperative multi-player game, where the players are the data
points to decide their class memberships and equilibria correspond to
consistent labeling of the data.
