Abstract#==#A typical social networking service (SNS) contains huge amounts of data, and
analyzing
this data at the level of the sentence is important.
In this paper, we describe our system for a SemEval2015 semantic textual
similarity task (task2). We present our approach, which uses edit distance to
consider
word order, and introduce word appearance in context. We report the results
from SemEval2015.
