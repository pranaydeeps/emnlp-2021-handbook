Abstract#==#This paper presents the system we developed for Task 11 of SemEval 2015. Our
system had two stages: The first one was based on deep autoencoders for
extracting features to compactly represent tweets. The next stage consisted of
a classifier or a regression function for estimating the polarity value
assigned to a given tweet. We tested several techniques in order to choose the
ones with the highest accuracy. Finally, three regression techniques revealed
as the best ones for assigning the polarity value to tweets. We presented six
runs corresponding to three regression different techniques in combination with
two variants of the autoencoder, one with input as bags of words and another
with input as bags of character 3-grams.
