Abstract#==#This report summarizes the objectives and evaluation of the SemEval 2015 task
on the sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twitter (Task 11). This is
the first sentiment analysis task wholly dedicated to analyzing figurative
language on Twitter. Specifically, three broad classes of figurative language
were considered: irony, sarcasm and metaphor. Gold standard sets of 8000
training tweets and 4000 test tweets were annotated using workers on the
crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. Participating systems were required to
provide a fine-grained sentiment score on an 11-point scale (-5 to +5,
including 0 for neutral intent) for each tweet, and systems were evaluated
against the gold standard using both a Cosine-similarity and a
Mean-Squared-Error measure.
