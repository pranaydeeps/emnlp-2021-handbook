Abstract#==#In this paper, we give an overview of our participation in the timeline
generation task of SemEval-2015 (task 4, TimeLine: Cross-Document Event
Ordering). The main goals of this new track are, given a collection of news
articles and a so-called target entity, to determine events that are relevant
for the entity, to resolve event coreferences, and to order the events
chronologically. We addressed the sub-tasks, in which event mentions were
provided, i.e., no additional event extraction was required. For this, we
developed an ad-hoc approach based on a temporal tagger and a coreference
resolution tool for entities. After determining relevant sentences, relevant
events are extracted and anchored on a timeline. The evaluation conducted on
three collections of news articles shows that our approach -- despite its
simplicity -- achieves reasonable results and opens several promising issues
for future work.
