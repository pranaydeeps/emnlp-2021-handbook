Abstract#==#This paper describes our deep learning system for sentiment analysis of tweets.
The main contribution of this work is a process to initialize the parameter
weights of the convolutional neural network, which is crucial to train an
accurate model while avoiding the need to inject any additional features.
Briefly, we use an unsupervised neural language model to initialize word
embeddings that are further tuned by our deep learning model on a distant
supervised corpus. At a final stage, the pre-trained parameters of the network
are used to initialize the model which is then trained on the supervised
training data from Semeval-2015.
According to results on the official test sets, our model ranks 1st in the
phrase-level subtask A (among 11 teams) and 2nd on the message-level subtask B
(among 40 teams). Interestingly, computing an average rank over all six test
sets (official              and five progress test sets) puts our system 1st in both
subtasks A and B.
