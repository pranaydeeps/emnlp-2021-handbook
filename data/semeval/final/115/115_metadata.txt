Abstract#==#We present in this paper our system developed for SemEval 2015 Shared Task 2
(2a - English Semantic Textual Similarity, STS, and 2c - Interpretable
Similarity) and the results of the submitted runs. For the English STS subtask,
we used regression models combining a wide array of features including semantic
similarity scores obtained from various methods. One of our runs achieved
weighted mean correlation score of 0.784 for sentence similarity subtask (i.e.,
English STS) and was ranked tenth among 74 runs submitted by 29 teams. For the
interpretable similarity pilot task, we employed a rule-based approach blended
with chunk alignment labeling and scoring based on semantic similarity
features. Our system for interpretable text similarity was among the top three
best performing systems.
