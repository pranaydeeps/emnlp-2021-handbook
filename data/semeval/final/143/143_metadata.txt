Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our entry to the SemEval 2015 clinical text analysis
task. We participated only in the disorder attribute detection task 2a. Our
main goal was to assess how well an information extraction system
originally developed for a different task and domain can be utilized in this
task. Our system, based on SVM and CRF classifiers, showed promising results,
placing 3rd out of 6 participants in this task with performance of 0.857
measured in weighted accuracy, the official evaluation metric.
