Abstract#==#This paper describes SWATAC, a system built for SemEval-2015's Task 10 Subtask
B, namely the Message Polarity Classification Task. Given a tweet, the system
classifies the sentiment as either positive, negative, or neutral. Several
preprocessing tasks such as negation detection, spell checking, and
tokenization are performed to enhance lexical information. The features are
then augmented with external sentiment lexicons. Classification is done with
Logistic Regression using a one-vs-rest configuration. For the test runs, the
system was trained using only the provided training tweets. The classifier was
successful, with an F1 score of 58.43 on the official 2015 test data, and an F1
score of 66.64 on the Twitter 2014 progress data.
