Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed by the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), for the 2015 SemEval shared task on
“Analysis of Clini-cal Text” (Task 14). We participated in both sub-tasks:
Task 1 for “Disorder Identification”, which aims to detect disorder
entities and encode them to UMLS (Unified Medial Language System) CUI (Concept
Unique Identifier) and Task 2 for Disorder Slot Filling, where the task is to
identify normalized value for modifiers of disorders. For Task 1, we developed
an ensemble approach that combined machine learning based named entity
recognition classifiers with MetaMap, an existing symbolic biomedical NLP
system, to recognize disorder entities, and we used a general Vector Space
Model-based approach for disorder encoding to UMLS CUIs. To identify modifiers
of disorders (Task 2), we developed Support Vector Machines-based classifiers
for each type of modifier, by exploring various types of features. Our system
was ranked 3rd for Task 1 and 1st for the Task 2 (both 2A and 2B),
demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for
extracting clinical entities and their modifiers from clinical narratives.
