Abstract#==#The 2015 Clinical TempEval Challenge addressed the problem of temporal
reasoning in the clinical domain by providing an annotated corpus of pathology
and clinical notes related to colon cancer patients. The challenge consisted of
six subtasks: TIMEX3 and event span detection, TIMEX3 and event attribute
classification, document relation time and narrative container relation
classification. Our BluLab team participated in all six subtasks. For the
TIMEX3 and event subtasks, we developed a ClearTK support vector machine
pipeline using mainly simple lexical features along with information from
rule-based systems. For the relation subtasks, we employed a conditional random
fields classification approach, with input from a rule-based system for the
narrative container relation subtask. Our team ranked first for all TIMEX3 and
event subtasks, as well as for the document relation subtask.
