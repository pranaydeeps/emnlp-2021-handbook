Abstract#==#This paper describes the outcomes of the TimeLine task (Cross-Document Event
Ordering), that was organised within the Time and Space track of SemEval-2015.
Given a set of documents and a set of target entities, the task consisted of
building a timeline for each entity, by detecting, anchoring in time and
ordering the events involving that entity. The TimeLine task goes a step
further than previous evaluation challenges by requiring participant systems to
perform both event coreference and temporal relation extraction across
documents. Four teams submitted the output of their systems to the four
proposed subtracks for a total of 13 runs, the best of which obtained an
F1-score of 7.85 in the main track (timeline creation from raw text).
