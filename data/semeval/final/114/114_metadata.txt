Abstract#==#This paper describes the participation of the UNIBA team in the Task 13 of
SemEval-2015 about Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity
Linking. 
We propose an algorithm able to disambiguate both word senses and named
entities by combining the simple Lesk approach with information coming from
both a distributional semantic model and usage frequency of meanings. The
results for both English and Italian show satisfactory performance.
