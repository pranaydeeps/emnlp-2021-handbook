Abstract#==#We describe the performance of UtahPOET on SemEval 2015 Task 14. UtahPOET is a
cognitively inspired system designed to extract semantic content from general
clinical texts. We find that our system performs much better on the context
slot-filling aspects of Tasks 2A and 2B than the disorder CUI mapping of Tasks
1 and 2B or the body location CUI mapping of Task 2B. Our problems with CUI
mapping suggested several possible system improvements. An alteration in the
correspondence between the system architecture and psycholinguistic findings is
also indicated.
