Abstract#==#Text is composed of words and phrases. In
bag-of-word model, phrases in texts are split
into words. This may discard the inner semantics
of phrases which in turn may give inconsistent
relatedness score between two texts.
TrWP, the unsupervised text relatedness approach
combines both word and phrase relatedness.
The word relatedness is computed
using an existing unsupervised co-occurrence
based method. The phrase relatedness is computed
using an existing unsupervised phrase
relatedness function f that adopts Sum-Ratio
technique based on the statistics in the Google
n-gram corpus of overlapping n-grams associated
with the two input phrases. The second
run of TrWP ranked 30th out of 73 runs in
SemEval-2015 task2a (English STS).
