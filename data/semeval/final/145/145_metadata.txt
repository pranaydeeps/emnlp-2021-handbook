Abstract#==#For the purposes of SemEval-2015 Task-18 on the semantic dependency parsing we
combined the best-performing closed track ap-proach from the SemEval-2014
competition with state-of-the-art techniques for FrameNet semantic parsing. In
the closed track our system ranked third for the semantic graph accuracy and
first for exact labeled match of complete semantic graphs. These results can be
attributed to the high accuracy of the C6.0 rule-based sense labeler adapted
from the FrameNet parser. To handle large SemEval training data the C6.0
algorithm was extended to provide multi-class classification and to use fast
greedy search without significant accuracy loss compared to exhaustive search.
A method for improved FrameNet parsing using semantic graphs is proposed.
