Abstract#==#Medical texts are filled with mentions of diseases, disorders, and other
clinical conditions, with many different surface forms relating to the same
condition. We describe MINERAL, a system for extraction and normalization of
disease mentions in clinical text, with which we participated in the Task 14 of
SemEval 2015 evaluation campaign. MINERAL relies on a conditional random
fields-based model with a rich set of features for mention detection, and a
semantic textual similarity measure for entity linking. MINERAL reaches joint
extraction and linking performance of 75.9% relaxed F1-score (strict score of
72.7%) and ranks fourth among 16 participating teams.
