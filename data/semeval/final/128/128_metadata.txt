Abstract#==#Community Question Answering (cQA) provides new interesting research directions
to the traditional Question Answering (QA) field, e.g., the exploitation of the
interaction between users and the structure of related posts. In this context,
we organized SemEval-2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in cQA, which included two
subtasks: (a) classifying answers as good, bad, or potentially relevant with
respect to the question, and (b) answering a YES/NO question with yes, no, or
unsure, based on the list of all answers. We set subtask A for Arabic and
English on two relatively different cQA domains, i.e., the Qatar Living website
for English, and a Quran-related website for Arabic. We used crowdsourcing on
Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large English training dataset, which we
released to the research community. Thirteen teams participated in the
challenge with a total of 61 submissions: 24 primary and 37 contrastive. The
best systems achieved an official score (macro-averaged F1) of 57.19 and 63.7
for the English subtasks A and B, and 78.55 for the Arabic subtask A.
