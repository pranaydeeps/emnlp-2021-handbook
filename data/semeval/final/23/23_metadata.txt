Abstract#==#Taxonomy structures are important tools in the science of classification of
things or concepts, including the principles that underlie such classification.
This paper presents an approach to the problem of taxonomy construction from
texts focusing on the hyponym-hypernym relation between two terms. Given a set
of terms in a particular domain, the approach in this study uses Wikipedia and
WordNet as knowledge sources and applies the information extraction methods to
analyze and establish the hyponym-hypernym relationship between two terms.  Our
system is ranked fourth among the participating systems in SemEval-2015 task
17.
