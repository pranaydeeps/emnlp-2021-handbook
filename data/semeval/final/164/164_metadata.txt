Abstract#==#This paper is a description of our system for SemEval-2015 Task 18:
Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing. 
We implement a hybrid parser which benefit from both transition-based and
graph-based parsing approaches.
In particular, the tree approximation method is explored to take advantage of
well-studied tree parsing techniques. 
Evaluation on multilingual data sets demonstrates that
considerably good semantic analysis can be automatically built by applying 
state-of-the-art data-driven parsing techniques.
