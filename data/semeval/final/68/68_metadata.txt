Abstract#==#We implemented a syntactic and semantic tagging system for SemEval 2015 Task
15: Corpus Pattern Analysis. For syntactic tagging, we present a Dependency
Chain Search Algorithm that is found to be effective at identifying
structurally distant subjects and objects. Other syntactic labels are
identified using rules defined over dependency parse structures and the output
of a verb classification module. Semantic tagging is performed using a simple
lexical mapping table combined with post-processing rules written over phrase
structure constituent types and named entity information. The final score of
our system is 0.530 F1, ranking second in this task.
