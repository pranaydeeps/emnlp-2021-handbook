Abstract#==#Paraphrase recognition is the task of identifying whether two pieces of natural
language represent similar meanings. This paper describes a system
participating in the shared task 1 of SemEval 2015, which is about paraphrase
detection and semantic similarity in twitter. Our approach is to exploit
semantically meaningful features to detect paraphrases. An existing
state-of-the-art model for predicting semantic similarity is adapted to this
task.

A wide variety of features is used, ranging from different types of models, to
lexical over lap and synset overlap. A maximum entropy classifier is then
trained on these features. In addition to the detection of paraphrases, a
similarity score is also predicted, using the probabilities of the classifier.
To improve the results, normalization is used as preprocessing step.

Our final system achieves a F1 score of 0.620 (10th out of 18 teams), and a
Pearson correlation of 0.515 (6th out of 13 teams).
