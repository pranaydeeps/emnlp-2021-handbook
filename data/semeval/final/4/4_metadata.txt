Abstract#==#This paper describes the yiGou system we developed to compute the semantic
similarity of two English sentences, which we submitted to the SemEval 2015
Task 2 (English subtask). The system uses a support vector machine model with
literal similarity, shallow syntactic similarity, WordNet-based similarity and
latent semantic similarity to predict the semantic similarity score of two
short texts. In our experiments, WordNet-based and LSA-based features performed
better than other features. Out of the 73 submitted runs, our two runs ranked
38th and 42th, with mean Pearson correlation 0.7114 and 0.6964 respectively.
