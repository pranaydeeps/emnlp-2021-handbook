Abstract#==#As part of the SemEval-2015 shared task on Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency
Parsing, we evaluate the performace of our last year's system
(TurboSemanticParser) on multiple languages and out-of-domain data. Our system
is characterized by a feature-rich linear model, that includes scores for first
and second-order dependencies (arcs, siblings, grandparents and co-parents).
For decoding this second-order model, we solve a linear relaxation of that
problem using alternating directions dual decomposition (AD3). The
experiments have shown that, even though the parser’s performance in Chinese
and Czech attains around 80% (not too far from English performance), domain
shift is a serious issue, suggesting domain adaptation as an interesting avenue
for future research.
