Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a new statistical method on sentiment analysis of
figurative language with the short texts (called tweets) collected from Twitter
for the SemEval-2015 Task 11. Particularly, the proposed model focuses on
classifying the tweets into three categories (i.e., sarcastic, ironic, and
metaphorical tweet) by extracting two main features (i.e., term features and
emotion patterns). Our experiments have been conducted with two datasets, which
are Trial set (1000 tweets) and Test set (4000 tweets). As a result, the
proposed method have shown that the performance (measured by the cosine
similarity) on the Trail set is about 74%, and on the Test set is about 90%
with sarcastic tweets, and 89% with ironic tweets.
