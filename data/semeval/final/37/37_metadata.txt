Abstract#==#This paper presents the HITSZ-ICRC system designed for the QA TempEval
challenge in SemEval-2015. The system used an integration approach to annotate
temporal information by merging temporal annotation results from different
temporal annotators. TIPSemB, ClearTK and TARSQI were used as temporal
annotators to get candidate temporal annotation results. Evaluation
demonstrated that our system was effective for improving the performance of
temporal information annotation, and achieved recalls of 0.18, 0.26 and 0.19 on
Blog, News and Wikipedeia test sets.
