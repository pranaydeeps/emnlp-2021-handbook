Abstract#==#Our participation at SemEval’s Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation
and Entity Linking task is described. An English entity linking (EL) system is
presented, which combines the annotations of four public open source EL
services. The annotations are combined through a weighted voting scheme
inspired on the ROVER method, which had not been previously tested on EL
outputs. Results on the task’s EL items were competitive.
