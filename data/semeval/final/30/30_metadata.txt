Abstract#==#We introduce an approach to word sense disambiguation and entity linking that
combines a set of complementary objectives in an extensible multi-objective
formalism. During disambiguation the system performs continuous optimization to
find optimal probability distributions over candidate senses. Verb senses are
disambiguated using a separate neural network model. Our results on noun and
verb sense disambiguation as well as entity linking outperform all other
submissions on the SemEval 2015 Task 13 for English.
