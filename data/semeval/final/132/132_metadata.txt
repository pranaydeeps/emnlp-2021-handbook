Abstract#==#When tweeting on a topic, Twitter users often post messages that convey the
same or similar meaning. We describe TweetingJay, a system for detecting
paraphrases and semantic similarity of tweets, with which we participated in
Task 1 of SemEval 2015. TweetingJay uses a supervised model that combines
semantic overlap and word alignment features, previously shown to be effective
for detecting semantic textual similarity. TweetingJay reaches 65.9% F1-score
and ranked fourth among the 18 participating systems. We additionally provide
an analysis of the dataset and point to some peculiarities of the evaluation
setup.
