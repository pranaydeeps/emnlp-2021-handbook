Abstract#==#This paper reports our submissions to community question answering task in
SemEval 2015, which consists of two subtasks: (1) predict the quality of
answers to given question as good, bad, or potentially relevant and (2)
identify yes, no or unsure response to a given YES/NO question based on the
good answers identified by subtask 1. For both subtasks, we adopted supervised
classification method and examined the effects of heterogeneous features
generated from community question answering data, such as bag-of-words, string
matching, semantic similarity, answerer information, answer-specific features,
question-specific features, etc. Our submitted primary systems ranked the forth
and the second for the two subtasks of English data respectively.
