Abstract#==#This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 15
of SemEval 2015. The goal of the task was to automatically 
construct dictionary entries (via a series of three subtasks). 
Our systems participated in subtask 2, which involved automatically
clustering the contexts in which a target word occurs into its
different senses. Our results are consistent with previous word
sense induction and discrimination findings, where it proves 
difficult to beat a baseline algorithm that assigns all instances
of a target word to a single sense. However, our method of 
predicting the number of senses automatically fared quite well.
