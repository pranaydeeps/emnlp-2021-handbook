Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis tends to focus on the polarity
of words, combining their values to detect
which portion of a text is opinionated.
CLIPEval wants to promote a more holistic
approach, looking at psychological researches
that frame the connotations of words as the
emotional values activated by them. The implicit
polarity of events is just one aspect of
connotative meaning and we address it with a
task that is based on a dataset of sentences annotated
as instantiations of pleasant and unpleasant
events previously collected in psychological
research as the ones on which human
judgments converge.
