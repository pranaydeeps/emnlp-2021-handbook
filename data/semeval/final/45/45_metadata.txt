Abstract#==#This paper reports our submissions to semantic textual similarity task, i.e.,
task 2 in Semantic Evaluation 2015. We built our systems using various
traditional features, such as string-based, corpus-based and syntactic
similarity metrics, as well as novel similarity measures based on distributed
word representations, which were trained using deep learning paradigms. Since
the training and test datasets consist of instances collected from various
domains, three different strategies of the usage of training datasets were
explored: (1) use all available training datasets and build a unified
supervised model for all test datasets; (2) select the most similar training
dataset and separately construct a individual model for each test set; (3)
adopt multi-task learning framework to make full use of available training
sets. Results on the test datasets show that using all datasets as training set
achieves the best averaged performance and our best system ranks 15 out of 73.
