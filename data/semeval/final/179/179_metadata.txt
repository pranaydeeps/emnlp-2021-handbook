Abstract#==#Open forum threads exhibit a great variability in the quality and quantity of
the answers they attract, making it difficult to manually moderate and separate
relevant from irrelevant content. The goal of SemEval 2015 Task 3 (Subtask A,
English) is to build systems that automatically distinguish between relevant
and irrelevant content in forum threads.

We extend a short answer assessment system to build relations between forum
questions and answers with respect to similarity, question type, and answer
content. The features are used in a sequence classifier to account for the
conversation character of threads. The performance of this approach is modest
in comparison to the other task participants and also to the per-
formance the system usually reaches in short answer assessment. However, the
new features implemented for this task are a first step in developing more
fine-grained question-answer features and identifying relevant answers.
