Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the TATO system which participated in the
SemEval-2015 Task 2a: “Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for English”. Our
system is trained on published datasets from the previous competitions. Based
on some machine learning techniques, it combines multiple similarity measures
of varying complexity ranging from simple lexical and syntactic similarity
measures to complex semantic similarity ones to compute semantic textual
similarity. Our final model consists of a simple linear combination of about 30
main features out of a numerous number of features experimented. The results
are promising, with Pearson’s coefficients on each individual dataset ranging
from 0.6796 to 0.8167 and an overall weighted mean score of 0.7422, well above
the task baseline system.
