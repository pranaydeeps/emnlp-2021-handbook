Abstract#==#Clinical TempEval 2015 brought the temporal information extraction tasks of
past TempEval campaigns to the clinical domain. Nine sub-tasks were included,
covering problems in time expression identification, event expression
identification and temporal relation identification. Participant systems were
trained and evaluated on a corpus of clinical notes and pathology reports from
the Mayo Clinic, annotated with an extension of TimeML for the clinical domain.
Three teams submitted a total of 13 system runs, with the best systems
achieving near-human performance on identifying events and times, but with a
large performance gap still remaining for temporal relations.
