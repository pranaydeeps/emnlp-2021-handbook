Abstract#==#This paper reports the description and performance of our system, FBK-HLT,
participating in the SemEval 2015, Task#2 "Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)",
English subtask. We submitted three runs with different hypothesis in combining
typical features (lexical similarity, string similarity, word n-grams, etc)
with syntactic structure features, resulting in different sets of features. The
results evaluated on both STS 2014 and 2015 datasets prove our hypothesis of
building a STS system taking into consideration of syntactic information. We
outperform the best system on STS 2014 datasets and achieve a very competitive
result to the best system on STS 2015 datasets.
