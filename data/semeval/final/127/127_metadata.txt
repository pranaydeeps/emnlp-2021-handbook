Abstract#==#Human languages exhibit a variety of strategies
for communicating spatial information,
including toponyms, spatial nominals, locations
that are described in relation to other locations,
and movements along paths. SpaceEval
is a combined information extraction and
classification task with the goal of identifying
and categorizing such spatial information.
In this paper, we describe the SpaceEval task,
annotation schema, and corpora, and evaluate
the performance of several supervised and
semi-supervised machine learning systems developed
with the goal of automating this task.
