Abstract#==#We describe a system for semantic role labeling adapted to a dependency parsing
framework. Verb arguments are predicted over nodes in a dependency parse tree
instead of nodes in a phrase-structure parse tree. Our system participated in
SemEval-2015 shared Task 15, Subtask 1: CPA parsing and achieved an F-score of
0.516. We adapted features from prior semantic role labeling work to the
dependency parsing paradigm, using a series of supervised classifiers to
identify arguments of a verb and then assigning syntactic and semantic labels.
We found that careful feature selection had a major impact on system
performance. However, sparse training data still led rule-based systems like
the baseline to be more effective than learning-based approaches.
