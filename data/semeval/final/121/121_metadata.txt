Abstract#==#This paper reports the description and performance of our system, FBK-HLT,
participating in the SemEval 2015, Task #3 "Answer Se- lection in Community
Question Answering" for English, for both subtasks. We submit two runs with
different classifiers in combining typical features (lexical similarity, string
similarity, word n-grams, etc) with machine translation evaluation metrics and
with some ad hoc features (e.g user overlapping, spam filtering). We outperform
the baseline system and achieve interesting results on the both subtasks.
