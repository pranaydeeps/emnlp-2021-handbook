Abstract#==#We use referential translation machines (RTMs) for predicting the semantic
similarity of text.
RTMs are a computational model effectively judging monolingual and bilingual
similarity while identifying 
translation acts between any two data sets with respect to interpretants.
RTMs pioneer a language independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove
the need to access any task or domain 
specific information or resource.
RTMs become the 2nd system out of 13 systems participating in Paraphrase and
Semantic Similarity in Twitter, 6th out of 
16 submissions in Semantic Textual Similarity Spanish, and 50th out of 73
submissions in Semantic Textual Similarity 
English.
