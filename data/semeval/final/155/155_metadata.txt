Abstract#==#We implemented an end-to-end system for disorder identification and slot
filling.
For identifying spans for both disorders and their attributes, we used a linear
chain conditional random field (CRF) approach coupled with cTAKES for
pre-processing.  For combining disjoint disorder spans, finding relations
between attributes and disorders, and attribute normalization, we used
l2-regularized l2-loss linear support vector machine (SVM) classification.
Disorder CUIs were identified using a back-off approach to YTEX lookup (CUAB1)
or NLM UTS API (CUAB2) if the target text was not found in the training data.
Our best system utilized UMLS semantic type features for disorder/attribute
span identification and the NLM UTS API for normalization. It was ranked 12th
in Task 1 (disorder identification) and 6th in Task 2b (disorder identification
and slot filling) with a weighted F Measure of 0.711.
