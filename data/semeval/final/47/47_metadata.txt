Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a baseline message-level sentiment
  classification method, as developed for SemEval-2015 Task 10, Subtask
  B.  This system leverages both hand-crafted features and document
  embedding features, and uses an SVM classifier for message-level
  sentiment classification. In pre-training the embedding features, we
  use 10 million randomly-selected tweets. We present results over
  SemEval-2015 Task 10, as well as the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Our
  experiments show the effectiveness of our method over both datasets.
