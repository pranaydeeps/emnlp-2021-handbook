Abstract#==#This paper describes the approach used by ezDI at the SemEval 2015 Task-14:
"Analysis of Clinical Text". The task was divided into two embedded tasks.
Task-1 required determining disorder boundaries (including the discontiguous
ones) from a given set of clinical notes and normalizing the disorders by
assigning a unique CUI from the UMLS/SNOMEDCT. Task-2 was about finding
different type of modifiers for given disorder mention. Task-2 was divided
further into two subtasks. In subtask-2a, gold set of disorder was already
provided and system needed to just fill modifier types in to the pre-specified
slots. Subtask 2b did not provide any gold set of disorders and both the
disorders and its related modifiers are to be identified by the system itself.
In Task-1 our system was ranked first with F-score of 0.757 for Strict
evaluation and 0.788 for relaxed evaluation. In both Task-2a and 2b our system
was placed second with weighted F-score of 0.88 and 0.795 respectively.
