Abstract#==#This paper reports on our participation at SemEval-2015 Task 12, which was
devoted to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.
Participants were required to identify the category (entity and attribute), the
opinion target, and polarity from the texts of customer reviews.
The system we built relies on classification algorithms to identify aspect
categories and on a set of rules to identify the opinion target.
We propose a two-phase classification approach for category identification and
use a simple method for polarity detection.
Our results outperform the baseline in many cases meaning that our system could
be used as an alternative for aspect classification.
