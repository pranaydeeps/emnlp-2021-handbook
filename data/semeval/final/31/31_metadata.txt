Abstract#==#This paper describes the SHELLFBK system
that participated in SemEval 2015 Tasks 9,
10 and 11. Our system takes a supervised
approach that builds on techniques from information
retrieval. The algorithm populates
an inverted index with pseudo-documents that
encode dependency parse relationships extracted
from the sentences in the training set.
Each record stored in the index is annotated
with the polarity and domain of the sentence
it represents. When the polarity or domain of
a new sentence has to be computed, the new
sentence is converted to a query that is used
to retrieve the most similar sentences from the
training set. The retrieved instances are scored
for relevance to the query. The most relevant
training instant is used to assign a polarity
and domain label to the new sentence. While
the results on well-formed sentences are encouraging,
the performance obtained on short
texts like tweets demonstrate that more work
is needed in this area.
