Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the 2015 iteration of the SemEval shared task on
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.                                      This was the most
popular
sentiment
analysis
shared task to date with more than 40 teams participating in each of the last
three years. This year's shared task competition consisted of five sentiment
prediction subtasks. Two were reruns from previous years: (A) sentiment
expressed by a phrase in the context of a tweet, and (B) overall sentiment of a
tweet. We further included three new subtasks asking to predict (C) the
sentiment towards a topic in a single tweet, (D) the overall sentiment towards
a topic in a set of tweets, and (E) the degree of prior polarity of a phrase.
