Abstract#==#This paper describes our systems submitted to the target-dependent sentiment
polarity classification subtask in aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task
(i.e., Task 12) in SemEval 2015. To settle this problem, we extracted several
effective features from three sequential sentences, including sentiment
lexicon, linguistic and domain specific features. Then we employed these
features to construct classifiers using supervised classification algorithm. In
laptop domain, our systems ranked 2nd out of 6 constrained submissions and 2nd
out of 7 unconstrained submissions. In restaurant domain, the rankings are 5th
out of 6 and 2nd out of 8 respectively.
