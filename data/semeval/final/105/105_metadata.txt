Abstract#==#This paper describes the AMBRA system, entered in the SemEval-2015 Task 7:
`Diachronic Text Evaluation' subtasks one and two, which consist of predicting
the date when a text was originally written. The task is valuable for
applications in digital humanities, information systems, and historical
linguistics. The novelty of this shared task consists of incorporating label
uncertainty by assigning an interval within which the document was written,
rather than assigning a clear time marker to each training document. To deal
with non-linear effects and variable degrees of uncertainty, we reduce the
problem to pairwise comparisons of the form is Document A older than Document
B?, and propose a non-parametric way to transform the ordinal output into time
intervals.
