Abstract#==#In this paper we describe a system that aims to recognize paraphrases in
Twitter by predicting if two tweets from the same topic are semantically
similar.
The system participated in Task1 of SemEval-2015 and uses a support vector
regression machine (SVR) to predict the degree of similarity. 
The predicted is then threshold to create binary predictions.
The model is and experimental results are discussed along with future work that
could improve the method.
