Abstract#==#This paper provides a detailed description of the approach of our system for
the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task of SemEval2015. The task is to
identify the Aspect Category (Entity and Attribute pair), Opinion Target and
Sentiment of the reviews. For the In-domain subtask that is provided with the
training data, the system is developed using a supervised technique called
Support Vector Machine and for the Out-of-domain subtask for which the training
data is not provided, it is implemented based on the sentiment score of the
vocabulary. For In-domain subtask, our system is developed specifically for
restaurant data.
