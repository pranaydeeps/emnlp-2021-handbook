Abstract#==#QA TempEval shifts the goal of previous TempEvals away from an intrinsic
evaluation methodology toward a more extrinsic goal of question answering.
This evaluation requires systems to capture temporal information relevant to
perform an end-user task, as opposed to corpus-based evaluation where all
temporal information is equally important.
Evaluation results show that the best automated TimeML annotations reach over
30% recall on questions with ‘yes’ answer and
about 50% on easier questions with ‘no’ answers.
Features that helped achieve better results are event coreference and a time
expression reasoner.
