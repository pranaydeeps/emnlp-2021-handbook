Abstract#==#In this paper we describe a novel task, namely the Diachronic Text Evaluation
task. A corpus of snippets which contain relevant infor- mation for the time
when the text was created is extracted from a large collection of newspa- pers
published between 1,700 and 2,010. The task, subdivided in three subtasks,
requires the automatic system to identify the time interval when the piece of
news was written. The intervals come in three grades: fine, medium and coarse
according to their length. The systems participating in the tasks have proved
that this a doable task with very interesting possible continuations.
