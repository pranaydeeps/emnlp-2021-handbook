Abstract#==#SemEval-2015 Task 12, a continuation of SemEval-2014 Task 4, aimed to foster
research beyond sentence- or text-level sentiment classification towards
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to identify opinions expressed
about specific entities (e.g., laptops) and their aspects (e.g., prices). The
task provided manually annotated reviews in three domains (restaurants, laptops
and hotels), and a common evaluation procedure. It attracted 93 submissions
from 16 teams.
