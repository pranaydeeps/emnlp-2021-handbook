Abstract#==#This paper describes the system we submitted to In-domain ABSA subtask of
SemEval 2015 shared task on aspect-based sentiment analysis that includes
aspect category detection and sentiment polarity classification. For the aspect
category detection, we combined an SVM classifier with implicit aspect
indicators. For the sentiment polarity classification, we combined an SVM
classifier with a lexicon-based polarity classifier. Our system outperforms the
baselines on both the laptop and restaurant domains and ranks above average on
the laptop domain.
