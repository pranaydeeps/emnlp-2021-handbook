Abstract#==#Unstructured clinical notes are rich sources for valuable patient information.
Information extraction techniques can be employed to extract this valuable
information, which in turn can be used to discover new knowledge. Named entity
recognition and normalization are the basic tasks involved in information
extraction. In this paper, identification of disorder named entities and the
mapping of identified disorder entities to SNOMED-CT terminology using UMLS
Metathesaurus is presented. A supervised linear chain conditional random field
model based on sets of features to predict disorder mentions is used in
conjunction with MetaMap to identify and normalize disorders. Error analysis
conclude that recall of the developed system can be significantly increased by
adding more features during model development and also by using frame based
approach for handling disjoint entities.
