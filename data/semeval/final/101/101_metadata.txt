Abstract#==#We present ExB Themis – a word alignment-based semantic textual similarity
system developed for SemEval-2015 Task 2: Semantic Textual Similarity. It
combines both string and semantic similarity measures as well as alignment
features using Support Vector Regression. It occupies the first three places on
Spanish data and additionally places second on English data. ExB Themis proved
to be the best multilingual system among all participants.
