This paper presents a Twitter-OpinMiner system for Twitter sentiment analysis
evaluation at SemEval 2015. Our approach stems from two different angles: topic
detection for discovering the sentiment distribution on different topics and
sentiment analysis based on a variety of features. Moreover, we also
implemented intra-sentence discourse relations for polarity identification. We
divided the discourse relations into 4 predefined categories, including
continuation, contrast, condition, and cause. These relations could facilitate
us to eliminate polarity ambiguities in compound sentences where both positive
and negative sentiments are appearing. Based on the SemEval 2014 and SemEval
2015 Twitter sentiment analysis task datasets, the experimental results show
that the performance of Twitter-OpinMiner could effectively recognize
opinionated messages and identify the polarities.
