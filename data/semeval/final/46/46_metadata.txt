Abstract#==#This paper describes our systems for
expression-level and message-level sentiment
analysis â€“ two subtasks of SemEval-2015
Task 10 on sentiment analysis in Twitter. First
we built two baseline systems for the two subtasks
using SVM with a variety of features.
Then we improved the systems through model
iteration and probability-output weighting
respectively. Our submissions are ranked the
3rd and 2nd among eleven teams on the 2015
test set and progress test set in subtask A and
the 7th and 4th among 40 teams on the two
test sets respectively in subtask B.
