Abstract#==#This paper describes a system developed for the disorder identification subtask
within task 14 of SemEval 2015. The developed system is based on a chain of two
modules, one for recognition and another for normalization. The recognition
module is based on an adapted version of the Stanford NER system to train CRF
models in order to recognize disorder mentions. CRF models were build based on
a novel encoding of entity spans as token classifications to also consider
non-continuous entities, along with a rich set of features based on (i) domain
lexicons and (ii) Brown clusters inferred from a large collection of clinical
texts. For disorder normalization, we (i) generated a non ambiguous dictionary
of abbreviations from the labelled files, using it together with (ii) an
heuristic method based on similarity search and (iii) a comparison method based
on the information content of each disorder. The system achieved an F-measure
of 0.740 (the second best), with a precision of 0.779, a recall of 0.705.
