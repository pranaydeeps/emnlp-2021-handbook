Abstract#==#In this paper we describe the SpRL-CWW entry into SemEval 2015: Task 8
SpaceEval. It detects spatial and motion relations as defined by the ISO-Space
specifications in two phases: (1) it detects spatial elements and
spatial/motion signals with a CRF model that uses a combination of distributed
word representations and lexico-syntactic features; (2) given relation
candidate tuples, it simultaneously detects relation types and labels the
spatial roles of participating elements by using a combination of syntactic and
semantic features in independent multi-class classification models for each
relation type. In evaluation on the shared task data, our system performed
particularly well on detection of elements and relations in unannotated data.
