Abstract#==#This paper describes Al-Bayan team participation
in SemEval-2015 Task 3, Subtask A. Task
3 targets semantic solutions for answer selection
in community question answering systems.
We propose a knowledge-based solution for
answer selection of Arabic questions, specialized
for Islamic sciences. We build a Semantic
Interpreter to evaluate the semantic similarity
between Arabic question and answers using
our Quranic ontology of concepts. Using supervised
learning, we classify the candidate
answers according to their relevance to the
users questions. Results show that our system
achieves 74.53% accuracy which is comparable
to the other participating systems.
