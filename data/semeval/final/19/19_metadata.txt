Abstract#==#We present two approaches to time expression identification, as entered in to
SemEval-2015 Task 6, Clinical TempEval. The first is a comprehensive rule-based
approach that favoured recall, and which achieved the best recall for time
expression identification in Clinical TempEval. The second is an SVM-based
system built using readily available components, which was able to achieve a
competitive F1 in a short development time. We discuss how the two approaches
perform relative to each other, and how characteristics of the corpus affect
the suitability of different approaches and their outcomes.
