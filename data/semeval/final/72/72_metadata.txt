Abstract#==#This paper describes the first shared task on Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation
organised as part of SemEval-2015. Participants were asked to find
hypernym-hyponym relations between given terms. For each of the four selected
target domains the participants were provided with two lists of domain-specific
terms: a WordNet collection of terms and a well-known terminology extracted
from an online publicly available taxonomy. A total of 45 taxonomies submitted
by 6 participating teams were evaluated using standard structural measures, the
structural similarity with a gold standard taxonomy, and through manual quality
assessment of sampled novel relations.
