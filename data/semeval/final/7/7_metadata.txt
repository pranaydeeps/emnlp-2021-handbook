Abstract#==#This paper describes the participation of the HITSZ-ICRC team on the Answer
Selection Challenge in SemEval-2015. Our team participated in English subtask
A, English subtask B and Arabic task. Two approaches, ensemble learning and
hierarchical classification were proposed for answer selection in each task.
Bag-of-words features, lexical features and non-textual features were employed.
For the Arabic task, features were extracted from both Arabic data and English
data that translated from the Arabic data. Evaluation demonstrated that the
proposed methods were effective, achieving a macro-averaged F1 of 56.41% (rank
2nd) in English subtask A, 53.60 % (rank 3rd) in English subtask B and 67.70%
(rank 3rd) in Arabic task, respectively.
