Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach for estimating the Semantic Textual Similarity
of full English sentences as specified in Shared Task 2 of SemEval-2015. The
semantic similarity of sentence pairs is quantified from three perspectives
structural, syntactical, and semantic. The numerical representations of the
derived similarity measures are then applied to train a regression ensemble.
Although none of these three sets of measures is able to rep-resent the
semantic similarity of two sentences individually, our experimental results
show that the combination of these features can precisely assess the semantic
similarity of the sentences. In the English subtask our systemâ€™s best result
ranked 35 among 73 system runs with 0.7189 average Pearson correlation over
five test sets. This was 0.08 correlation points less than the best submitted
run.
