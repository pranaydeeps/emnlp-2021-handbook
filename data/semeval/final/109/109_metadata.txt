Abstract#==#This paper describes the details of our system submitted to the SemEval 2015
shared task on sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twitter. We tackle
the problem as regression task and combine several base systems using stacked
generalization (Wolpert, 1992). An initial analysis revealed that the data is
heavily biased, and a general sentiment analysis system (GSA) performs poorly
on it. However, GSA proved helpful on the test data, which contains an
estimated 25% non-figurative tweets. Our best system, a stacking system with
backoff to GSA, ranked 4th on the final test data (Cosine 0.661, MSE 3.404).
