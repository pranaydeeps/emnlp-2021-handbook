Abstract#==#We present in this paper our submission to task 13 of SemEval2015, which makes
use
of background information and external resources (DBpedia and Wikipedia) to
automatically
disambiguate texts. Our approach follows two routes for disambiguation: one
route
is proposed by a state–of–the–art WSD system, and the other one by the
predominant
sense information extracted in an unsupervised way from an automatically built
background
corpus. We reached 4th position in terms of F1-score in task number 13 of
SemEval2015:
“Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking” (Moro and
Navigli, 2015). All the software and code created for this approach is publicly
available
on GitHub (https://github.com/cltl/vua-wsd-sem2015).
