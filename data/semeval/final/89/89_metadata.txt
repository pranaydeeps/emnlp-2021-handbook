Abstract#==#‎Answer Validation is an important step in Automatic Question Answering
systems and nowadays by spreading Community Question Answering systems it is
known as an important task by itself‎. ‎Previous works just considered it
as a binary classification problem in which they try to find the best answer
among all the candidate answers for a question‎. Accordingly, they do not
consider the possible unique information which may have been included other
answers‎. ‎This can be considered by having a multiclass label
classification problem, it is not only able to find the best answer but also
can find "potentially good", "bad", and etc‎. ‎answers too‎. By doing so,
it is fully expected to extract and rate ‎all the necessary information from
existing candidates to help questioner to find the best ‎and general answer
for his question‎. ‎This work tries to consider some features which are
gained from importance of comments of the questioner‎. ‎Finally‎, ‎by
using a good classifier‎, ‎we try to overcome this problem‎. ‎The
designed system participated in subtask A of the Semeval-2015 Task 3‎. ‎The
primary submission ranked at the 5th and 7th places in four class label and
three class label evaluation‎, ‎accordingly‎.
