Abstract#==#This paper describes TwitterHawk, a system for sentiment analysis of tweets
which participated in the SemEval-2015 Task 10, Subtasks A through D. The
system performed competitively, most notably placing 1st in topic-based
sentiment classification (Subtask C) and ranking 4th out of 40 in identifying
the sentiment of sarcastic tweets. Our submissions in all four subtasks used a
supervised learning approach to perform three-way classification to assign
positive, negative, or neutral labels. Our system development efforts focused
on text pre-processing and feature engineering, with a particular focus on
handling negation, integrating sentiment lexicons, parsing hashtags, and
handling expressive word modifications and emoticons. Two separate classifiers
were developed for phrase-level and tweet-level sentiment classification. Our
success in aforementioned tasks came in part from leveraging the Subtask B data
and building a single tweet-level classifier for Subtasks B, C and D.
