Abstract#==#This paper describes the second version of the ASAP system and its
participation in the SemEval-2015, task 2a on Semantic Textual Similarity
(STS). Our approach is based on computing the WordNet semantic
relatedness and similarity of phrases from distinct sentences. We also apply
topic modeling to get topic distributions over a set of sentences as well as
some linguistic heuristics. In a special addition for this task, we retrieve
named entities and compound nouns from DBPedia. All these features are used to
feed a regression algorithm that learns the STS function.
