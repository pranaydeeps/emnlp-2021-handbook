Abstract#==#Continuous word and phrase vectors have proven useful in a number of
NLP tasks. Here we describe our experience using them as a source of features
for the SemEval-2015 task 3, consisting of two community question answering
subtasks: Answer Selection for categorizing answers as "potential", "good", and
"bad" with regards to their corresponding questions; and YES/NO inference for
predicting a "yes", "no", or "unsure" response to a YES/NO question using all
of its "good" answers. Our system ranked 6th and 1st in the English answer
selection and YES/NO inference subtasks respectively, and 2nd in the Arabic
answer selection subtask.
