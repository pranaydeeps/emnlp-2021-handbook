Abstract#==#In this paper we present the Multilingual All-Words
Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
and Entity Linking (EL) 
are well-known problems in the Natural Language
Processing field and both address the lexical ambiguity of language. Their main
difference lies in the kind of meaning inventories that are used: EL uses
encyclopedic knowledge,
while WSD uses lexicographic information. Our aim with this task is to analyze
whether, and if so, how, using
a resource that integrates both kinds
of inventories (i.e., BabelNet 2.5.1) might enable WSD and EL to be solved by
means of similar (even, the same)
methods. Moreover, we investigate this task in a multilingual
setting and for some specific domains.
