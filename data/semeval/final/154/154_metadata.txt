Abstract#==#SUDOKU's submissions to SemEval Task 13 treats Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
and Entity Linking (EL) as a deterministic problem that exploits two key
attributes of open-class words as constraints -- their degree of polysemy and
their part of speech. This is an extension and further validation of the
results achieved by Manion & Sainudiin (2014). SUDOKU's three submissions are
incremental in the use of the two aforementioned constraints. Run1 has no
constraints and disambiguates all lemmas in one pass. Run2 disambiguates lemmas
at increasing degrees of polysemy, leaving the most polysemous until last. Run3
is identical to Run2, with the additional constraint of disambiguating all
named entities and nouns first before other types of open-class words (verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs). Over all-domains, for English Run2 and Run3 were
placed second and third. For Spanish Run2, Run3, and Run1 were placed first,
second, and third respectively. For Italian Run1 was placed first with Run2 and
Run3 placed second equal.
