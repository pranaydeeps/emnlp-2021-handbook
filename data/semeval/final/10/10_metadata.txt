Abstract#==#This paper describes our system used in the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
Task 12 of SemEval-2015. Our system is based on two supervised machine learning
algorithms: sigmoidal feedforward network to train binary classifiers for
aspect category classification (Slot 1), and Conditional Random Fields to train
classifiers for opinion target extraction (Slot 2). We extract a variety of
lexicon and syntactic features, as well as cluster features induced from
unlabeled data. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performances, ranking 1st
for three of the evaluations (Slot 1 for both restaurant and laptop domains,
and Slot 1 & 2) and 2nd for Slot 2 evaluation.
