Abstract#==#This paper describes our contribution to the SemEval-2015 task 17 on "Taxonomy
Extraction Evaluation".
We propose a hypernym detection system combining three modules: a
lexico-syntactic pattern matcher, a morpho-syntactic analyzer and a module
retrieving hypernym relations from structured lexical resources.
Our system ranked first in the competition when considering the gold standard
and manual evaluation, and second in the overall ranking.In addition, the
experimental results show that all modules contribute to finding hypernym
relations between terms.
