Abstract#==#We present the LIMSI submission to the Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation
and Entity Linking task of SemEval-2015. The system exploits the parallelism of
the multilingual test data and uses translations as source of indirect
supervision for sense selection. The LIMSI system gets best results in English
in all domains and shows that alignment information can successfully guide
disambiguation. This simple but effective method can serve to generate high
quality sense annotated data for WSD system training.
