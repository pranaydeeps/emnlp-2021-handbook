Abstract#==#This paper describes our Align-and-Differentiate approach to the SemEval 2015
Task 2 competition for English Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) systems. Our
submission achieved the top place on two of the five evaluation datasets. Our
team placed 3rd among 28 participating teams, and our three runs ranked 4th,
6th and 7th among the 73 runs submitted by the 28 teams. Our approach improves
upon the UMBC PairingWords system by semantically differentiating
distributionally similar terms. This novel addition improves results by 2.5
points on the Pearson correlation measure.
