Abstract#==#This paper describes clinical disorder recognition and encoding system
submitted by IHS R&D Belarus team at the SemEval-2015 shared task related to
analysis of clinical texts. Our system is based on IHS Goldfire Linguistic
Processor and uses a rich set of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. The
proposed system consists of two components: a CRF-based approach to recognize
disorder entities and empirical ranking to encode disorders to UMLS CUIs.
Evaluation on the test data set showed that our system achieved the F-measure
of 0.898 for entity recognition and the F-measure of 0.793 for UMLS CUI
encoding. The combined score for whole task is 0.690 (rank 17 out of 40
submissions).
