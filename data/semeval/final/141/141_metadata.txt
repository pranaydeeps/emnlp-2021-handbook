Abstract#==#CLaC Labs participated in two shared tasks for SemEval2015, Task 10 (subtasks B
and E) and Task 11. The underlying system configuration is nearly identical and
consists of two major components: a large Twitter lexicon compiled from tweets
that carry certain selected hashtags (assumed to guarantee a sentiment
polarity) and then inducing that same polarity for the words that occur in the
tweets. We also use standard sentiment lexica and combine the results. The
lexical sentiment features are further differentiated according to some
linguistic contexts in which their triggers occur, including bigrams, negation,
modality, and dependency triples. We studied feature combinations
comprehensively for their interoperability and effectiveness on different
datasets using the exhaustive feature combination technique of (Shareghi and
Bergler, 2013a; Shareghi and Bergler, 2013b). For Subtask 10B we used a SVM,
and a decision tree regressor for Task 11. The resulting systems ranked ninth
for Subtask 10B, fourth for Subtask 10E, and first for Task 11.
