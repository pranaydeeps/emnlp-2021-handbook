Abstract#==#The LT3 system perceives ABSA as a task consisting of three main subtasks,
which have to be tackled incrementally, namely aspect term extraction,
aggregation and polarity classification. For the first two steps, we see that
employing a hybrid terminology extraction system leads to promising results,
especially when it comes to recall. For the polarity classification, we show
that it is possible to gain satisfying accuracies, even on out-of-domain data,
with a basic model employing only lexical information.
