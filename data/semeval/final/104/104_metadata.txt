Abstract#==#We describe a classifier for predicting message-level sentiment of English
micro- blog messages from Twitter. This paper describes our submission to the
SemEval- 2015 competition (Task 10). Our approach is to combine several
variants of our previous yearâ€™s SVM system into one meta-classifier, which
was then trained using a random forest. The main idea is that the
meta-classifier allows the combination of the strengths and overcome some of
the weaknesses of the artificially-built individual classifiers, and adds
additional non-linearity. We were also able to improve the linear classifiers
by using a new regularization technique we call flipout.
