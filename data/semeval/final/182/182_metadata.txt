Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our approach to Semeval 2015 task 10 subtask B,
message level sentiment detection. Our system implements a variety of
classifiers and data preparation techniques from previous work. The set of
features and classifiers used in the final system produced consistently strong
results using cross-validation on the provided training data. Our final system
achieved an F-score of 57.60 on the provided test data. The overall best
performing system had an F-score of 64.84.
