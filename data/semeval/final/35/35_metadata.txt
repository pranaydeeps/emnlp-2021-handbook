Abstract#==#In this paper we present our solution for obtaining sentiment at message-level
of short sentences. The system combines the use of polarity dictionaries and
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to obtain syntactic and semantic features,
which are afterwards fed to a statistical classifier in order to obtain the
sentence polarity. Our solution was evaluated in the SemEval 2015 Task 10,
subtask B: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, achieving competitive performance in
all testsets.
