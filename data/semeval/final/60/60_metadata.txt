Abstract#==#This paper describes the first SemEval task to explore the use of Natural
Language Processing systems for building dictionary entries, within the
framework of Corpus Pattern Analysis. CPA is a corpus-driven technique which
provides tools and resources to identify and represent unambiguously the main
semantic patterns in which words are used. This task draws on the Pattern
Dictionary of English Verbs (http://www.pdev.org.uk), for the targeted lexical
entries, and on the British National Corpus for the input text.

Dictionary entry building is split into three subtasks which all start from a
concordance sample: 1) CPA parsing, where arguments and their syntactic and
semantic categories have to be identified, 2) CPA clustering, in which
sentences with similar patterns have to be clustered and 3) CPA automatic
lexicography where the structure of patterns have to be constructed
automatically.

Subtask 1 attracted 3 teams, though none could beat the baseline (rule-based
system). Subtask 2 attracted 2 teams, one of which beat the baseline
(majority-class classifier).  Subtask 3 did not attract any participant. 

The task has produced a major semantic multi-dataset resource which includes
data for 121 verbs and about 17,000 annotated sentences, and which is freely
accessible.
