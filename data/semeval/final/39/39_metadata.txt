Abstract#==#For information retrieval, it is useful to classify documents using a hierarchy
of terms from a domain. One problem is that, for many domains, hierarchies of
terms are not available. The task 17 of SemEval 2015 addresses the problem of
structuring a set of terms from a given domain into a taxonomy without manual
intervention. Here we present some simple taxonomy structuring techniques, such
as term overlap and document and sentence co-occurrence in large quantities of
text (English Wikipedia) to produce hypernym pairs for the eight domain lists
supplied by the task organizers. Our submission ranked first in this 2015
benchmark, which suggests that overly complicated methods might need to be
adapted to individual domains. Here, we describe our generic techniques and
present an initial evaluation of results.
