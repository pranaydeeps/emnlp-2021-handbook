Abstract#==#This paper presents the SWATCS65 ensemble classifier used to identify the
sentiment of tweets. The classifier was trained and tested using data provided
by Semeval-2015, Task 10, subtask B with the goal to label the sentiment of an
entire tweet. The ensemble was constructed from 26 classifiers, each written by
a group of one to three undergraduate students in the Fall 2014 offering of a
natural language processing course at Swarthmore College. Each of the
classifiers was designed independently, though much of the early structure was
provided by in-class lab assignments. There was high variability in the final
performance of each of these classifiers, which were combined using a weighted
voting scheme with weights correlated with performance using 5-fold
cross-validation on the provided training data. The system performed very well,
achieving an F1 score of 61.89.
