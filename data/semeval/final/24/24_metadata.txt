Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed by our team (HLTC-HKUST) for task 1
of SemEval 2015 workshop about paraphrase classification and semantic
similarity in Twitter. We trained a neural network classifier over a range of
features that includes translation metrics, lexical and syntactic similarity
score and semantic features based on semantic roles. The neural network was
trained taking into consideration in the objective function the six different
similarity levels provided in the corpus, in order to give as output a more
fine-grained estimation of the similarity level of the two sentences, as
required by subtask 2. With an F-score of $0.651$ in the binary paraphrase
classification subtask 1, and a Pearson coefficient of $0.697$ for the sentence
similarity subtask 2, we achieved respectively the 6th place and the 3rd place,
above the average of what obtained by the other contestants.
