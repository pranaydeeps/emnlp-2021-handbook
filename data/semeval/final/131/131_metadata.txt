Abstract#==#We describe a Twitter sentiment analysis system developed by combining a
rule-based classifier with supervised learning. We submitted our results for
the message-level subtask in SemEval 2015 Task 10, and achieved a F1-score of
57.06%. The rule-based classifier is based on rules that are dependent on the
occurrences of emoticons and opinion words in tweets. Whereas, the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on semantic, dependency, and sentiment lexicon
based features. The tweets are classified as positive, negative or unknown by
the rule-based classifier, and as positive, negative or neutral by the SVM. The
results we obtained show that rules can help refine the SVMâ€™s predictions.
