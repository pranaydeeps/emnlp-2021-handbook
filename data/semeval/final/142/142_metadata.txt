Abstract#==#We developed a system to participate in shared tasks on the analyzing clinical
text. Our system approaches are both machine learning-based and rule-based. We
applied the machine learning-based approach for Task 1: disorder
identification, and the rule-based approach for Task 2: template slot filling
for the disorder. In Task 1, we developed a supervised conditional random
fields model that was based on a rich set of features, and used for predicting
disorder mentions. In Task 2, we based on the dependency tree to build a rule
set. This rule set was extracted from the training data and applied to fill
values of disorder attribute types on the test data. The evaluation on the test
data showed that our system achieved the F-score of 0.656 (0.685 in case of
relaxed score) for Task 1 and the F*WA of 0.576 for Task 2A and the F*WA of
0.671 for Task 2B.
