Abstract#==#Natural language processing and text analysis methods offer the potential of
uncovering hidden associations from large amounts of un- processed texts. The
SemEval-2015 Analysis of Clinical Text task aimed at fostering re- search on
the application of these methods in the clinical domain. The proposed task
consisted of disorder identification with normalization to SNOMED-CT concepts,
and disorder attribute identification, or template filling.
We participated in both sub-tasks, using a combination of machine-learning and
rules for recognizing and normalizing disease mentions, and rule-based methods
for template filling. We achieved an F-score of 71.2% in the entity recognition
and normalization task, and a slot weighted accuracy of 69.5% in the template
filling task.
