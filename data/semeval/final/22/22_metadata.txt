Abstract#==#This paper describes the USAAR-WLV taxonomy induction system that participated
in the Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation task of SemEval-2015. We extend the work
on using vector space models for hypernym-hyponym extraction by simplifying the
means to extract a feature function that transforms any hyponym to its
hypernym. This is done by capitalizing on function words that are often
overlooked in vector space approaches to NLP. Our systems performs best in the
chemical domain and has achieved competitive results in the overall
evaluations.
