Abstract#==#This paper describes our contribution to the SemEval-2015 Task 11 on sentiment
analysis of figurative language in Twitter. We considered two approaches,
classification and regression, to provide fine-grained sentiment scores for a
set of tweets that are rich in sarcasm, irony and metaphor. To this end, we
combined a variety of standard lexical and syntactic features with specific
features for capturing figurative content. All experiments were done using
supervised learning with LIBSVM. For both runs, our system ranked fourth among
fifteen submissions.
