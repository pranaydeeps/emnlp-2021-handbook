Abstract#==#Like SemEval 2013 and 2014, the task Sentiment Analysis in Twitter found a
place in this year's SemEval too and attracted an unprecedented number of
participations. This task comprises of four sub-tasks. We participated in
subtask 2 --- Message polarity classification. Although we lie a few notches
down from the top system, we present a very simple yet effective approach to
handle this problem that can be implemented in a single day!
