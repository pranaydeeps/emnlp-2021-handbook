Abstract#==#The DsUniPi team participated in the SemEval 2015 Task#11: Sentiment Analysis
of Figurative Language in Twitter. The proposed approach employs syntactical
and morphological features, which indicate sentiment polarity in both
figurative and non-figurative tweets. These features were combined with others
that indicate presence of figurative language in order to fine-grain the
predicted sentiment. The method is supervised and makes use of structured
knowledge resources, such as SentiWordNet sentiment lexicon for assigning
sentiment score to words and WordNet for calculating word similarity. We have
experimented with different classification algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision
trees, and Support Vector Machines), and the best results were achieved by an
SVM classifier with linear kernel.
