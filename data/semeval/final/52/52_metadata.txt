Abstract#==#This paper reports our submission to task 10 (Sentiment Analysis on Tweet, SAT)
(Rosen thal et al., 2015) in SemEval 2015 , which contains five subtasks, i.e.,
contextual polarity disambiguation (subtask A: expression level), message
polarity classification (subtask B: message-level), topic-based message
polarity classification and detecting trends towards a topic (subtask C and D:
topic-level), and determining sentiment strength of twitter terms (subtask E:
term-level). For the first four subtasks, we built supervised models using
traditional features and word embedding features to perform sentiment polarity
classification. For subtask E, we first expanded the training data with the aid
of external sentiment lexicons and then built a regression model to estimate
the sentiment strength. Despite the sim-
plicity of features, our systems rank above the average.
