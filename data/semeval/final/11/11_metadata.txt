Abstract#==#This paper describes our sentiment classification system submitted to
SemEval-2015 Task 10. In the message-level polarity classification subtask, we
obtain the highest macro-averaged F1-scores on three out of six testing sets.
Specifically, we build a two-stage classifier to predict the sentiment labels
for tweets, which enables us to design different features for
subjective/objective classification and positive/negative classification. In
addition to n-grams, lexicons, word clusters, and twitter-specific features, we
develop several deep learning methods to automatically extract features for the
message-level sentiment classification task. Moreover, we propose a polarity
boosting trick which improves the performance of our system.
