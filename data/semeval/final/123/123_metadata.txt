Abstract#==#This paper describes a sentiment classification system designed for
SemEval-2015, Task 10, Subtask B. The system employs a constrained, supervised
text categorization approach. Firstly, since thorough preprocessing of tweet
data was shown to be effective in previous SemEval sentiment classification
tasks, various preprocessessing steps were introduced to enhance the quality of
lexical information. Secondly, a Naive Bayes classifier is used to detect tweet
sentiment.  The classifier is trained only on the training data provided by the
task organizers. The system makes use of external human-generated lists of
positive and negative words at several steps throughout classification. The
system produced an overall F-score of 59.26 on the official test set.
