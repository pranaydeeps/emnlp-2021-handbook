Abstract#==#This paper presents a supervised Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) system.
Our aim is to develop a modular platform which allows to easily conduct
experiments by replacing the modules or adding new features. We obtain the best
result in the Opinion Target Extraction (OTE) task (slot 2) using an
off-the-shelf sequence labeler. The target polarity classification (slot 3) is
addressed by means of a multiclass SVM algorithm which includes lexical based
features such as the polarity values obtained from domain and open polarity
lexicons. The system obtains accuracies of 0.70 and 0.73 for the restaurant and
laptop domain respectively, and performs second best in the out-of-domain
hotel, achieving an accuracy of 0.80.
