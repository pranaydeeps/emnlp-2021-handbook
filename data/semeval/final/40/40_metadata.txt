Abstract#==#This paper reports the description and performance of our system, FBK-HLT,
participating in the SemEval 2015, Task#1 "Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity
in Twitter", for both subtasks. We submitted two runs with different
classifiers in combining typical features (lexical similarity, string
similarity, word n-grams, etc) with machine translation metrics and edit
distance features. We outperform the baseline system and achieve a very
competitive result to the best system on the first subtask. Eventually, we are
ranked 4th out of 18 teams participating in subtask
"Paraphrase Identification".
