Abstract#==#The quality of statistical machine translation performed with phrase based
approaches can be increased by permuting the words in the source sentences in
an order which resembles that of the target language. We propose a class of
recurrent neural models which exploit source-side dependency syntax features to
reorder the words into a target-like order. We evaluate these models on the
German-to-English language pair, showing significant improvements over a
phrase-based Moses baseline, obtaining a quality similar or superior to that of
hand-coded syntactical reordering rules.
