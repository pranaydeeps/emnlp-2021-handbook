Abstract#==#We describe 2 improvements to Chinese- English PropBank predicate-argument
structure alignment. Taking advantage of the recently expanded PropBank
English nominal and adjective predicate annotation, we performed predicate-
argument alignments between both verb and nominal/adjective predicates in
Chinese and English. Using our alignment system, this increased the number of
aligned predicate- argument structures by 24.5% on the parallel Xinhua News
corpus. We also improved the PropBank alignment system using
expectation-maximization (EM) techniques. By collecting Chinese-English
predicate-to- predicate and argument type-to-argument type alignment
probabilities and iteratively improving the alignment output using these
probabilities on a large unannotated parallel corpora, we improved the
predicate alignment performance by 1 F point when using all automatic SRL and
word alignment inputs.
