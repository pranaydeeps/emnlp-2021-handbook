Abstract#==#Lexical false friends (FF) are the phenomena where words that look the same, do
not have the same meaning or lexical usage. FF impose several challenges to
statistical machine translation. We present a methodology which exploits word
context modeling as well as information provided by word alignments for
identifying false friends and choosing the right sense for them in the context.
We show that our approach enhances SMT lexical choice for false friends across
language variants. We demonstrate that our approach reduces word error rate
(WER) and position independent error rate (PER) for Egyptian-English SMT by
0.6% and 0.1% compared to the baseline.
