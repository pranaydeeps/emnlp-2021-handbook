Abstract#==#Translation of named-entities (NEs) is an issue in SMT. In this paper we
analyze the errors when translating NEs with a SMT system from English to
Spanish. We train on Europarl and test on News Commentary, focusing on entities
correctly recognized by an automatic NE recognition system. The automatic
systems translate around 85% NEs correctly, leaving a small margin for
improving performance. In addition, we implement a purpose-build NE translator
and integrate it in the SMT system, yielding a small but significant
improvement in BLEU score. Our analysis shows that, contrary to similar systems
translating from Chinese to English, there was no improvement in NE
translation, prompting further work.
