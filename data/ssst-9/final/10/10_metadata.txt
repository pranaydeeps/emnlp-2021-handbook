Abstract#==#Morphological segmentation is an effective strategy for addressing difficulties
caused by morphological complexity.
In this study, we use an English-to-Arabic test bed to determine what steps and
components of a phrase-based statistical machine translation pipeline benefit
the most from segmenting the target language.
We test several scenarios that differ primarily in when desegmentation is
applied, showing that the most important criterion for success in segmentation
is to allow the system to build target words from morphemes that span phrase
boundaries.
We also investigate the impact of segmented and unsegmented target language
models (LMs) on translation quality.
We show that an unsegmented LM is helpful according to BLEU score, but also
leads to a drop in the overall usage of compositional morphology, bringing it
to well below the amount observed in human references.
