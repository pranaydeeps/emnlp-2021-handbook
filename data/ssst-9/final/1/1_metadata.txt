Abstract#==#Accurate identification of phrasal translation equivalents is critical to both
phrase-based and syntax-based machine translation systems. We show that the
extraction of many phrasal translation equivalents is made impossible by word
alignments done without taking syntactic structures into consideration. To
address the problem, we propose a new annotation scheme where word alignment
and the alignment of non-terminal nodes (i.e., phrases) are done simultaneously
to avoid conflicts between word alignments and syntactic structures. Relying on
this new alignment approach, we construct a Hierarchically Aligned
Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT), and show that all phrasal
translation equivalents can be automatically extracted based on the phrase
alignments in HACEPT.
