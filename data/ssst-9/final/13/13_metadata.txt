Abstract#==#Semantic knowledge has been adopted recently for SMT preprocessing, decoding
and
evaluation, in order to be able to compare sentences based on their meaning
rather than on mere lexical and syntactic similarity. Little attention has been
paid to semantic knowledge in the context of integrating fuzzy matches
from a translation memory with SMT. We present work in progress which focuses
on
semantics-based pretranslation before decoding in SMT. This involves applying
fuzzy matching metrics based on lexical semantics and semantic roles, aligning
parse trees based on semantic roles, and pretranslating matching source
sentence parts using aligned tree nodes.
