Abstract#==#This paper argues in favor of a linguistically-informed error classification
for SMT to identify system weaknesses and map them to possible syntactic,
semantic and structural fixes. We propose a scheme which includes both
linguistic-oriented error categories as well as SMT-oriented edit errors, and
evaluate
an English-Spanish system and an English Basque system developed for a Q&A
scenario in the IT domain. The classification, in our use-scenario, reveals
great potential for fixes from lexical semantics techniques involving entity
handling for IT-related names and user interface strings, word sense
disambiguation for terminology, as well as argument structure for prepositions
and syntactic parsing for various levels of reordering.
