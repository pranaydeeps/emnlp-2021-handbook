Abstract#==#Neuroimaging while participants listen to audiobooks provides a rich data
source for theories of incremental parsing. We compare nested regression models
of these data. These mixed-effects models incorporate linguistic predictors at
various grain sizes ranging from part-of-speech bigrams,
through surprisal on context-free treebank grammars, to incremental node counts
in trees that are derived by Minimalist Grammars. The fine-grained structures
make an independent contribution over and above coarser predictors. However,
this result only obtains with time courses from anterior temporal lobe (aTL).
In analogous time courses from inferior frontal gyrus, only n-grams improve
upon a non-syntactic baseline. These results support the idea that aTL does
combinatoric processing during naturalistic story comprehension, processing
that bears a systematic relationship to linguistic structure.
