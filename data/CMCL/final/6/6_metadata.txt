Abstract#==#In conversation, speakers tend to echo the linguistic style of the person they
are interacting with. This paper contributes to a body of work that addresses
how this linguistic style coordination is affected by the social context in
which the interaction occurs. In particular, we investigate the effect that an
agentâ€™s social network centrality has on the coordination exhibited in
replies to their utterances. We find that linguistic coordination is positively
correlated with social network centrality and that this effect is greater than
previous results showing a similar connection between status-based power and
linguistic coordination. We conjecture that the social value of coordination
may reside in the wish to conform to the linguistic norms of a community.
