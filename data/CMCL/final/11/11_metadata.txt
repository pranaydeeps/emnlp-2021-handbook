Abstract#==#Models of language acquisition are typically evaluated against a “gold
standard” meant to represent adult linguistic knowledge, such as orthographic
words for the task of speech segmentation. Yet adult knowledge is rarely the
target knowledge for the stage of acquisition being modeled, making the gold
standard an imperfect evaluation metric. To supplement the gold standard
evaluation metric, we propose an alternative utility-based metric that measures
whether the acquired knowledge facilitates future learning. We take the task of
speech segmentation as a case study, assessing previously proposed models of
segmentation on their ability to generate output that (i) enables creation of
language-specific segmentation cues that rely on stress patterns, and (ii)
assists the subsequent acquisition task of learning word meanings. We find that
behavior that maximizes gold standard performance does not necessarily maximize
the utility of the acquired knowledge, highlighting the benefit of multiple
evaluation metrics.
