Abstract#==#Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) have been successful at modeling the
meaning of individual words, with interest recently shifting to compositional
structures, i.e., phrases and sentences. Network-based DSMs represent and
handle semantics via operators applied on word neighborhoods, i.e., semantic
graphs containing a target's most similar words. We extend network-based DSMs
to address compositionality using an activation model (motivated by
psycholinguistics) that operates on the fused neighborhoods of variable size
activation. The proposed method is evaluated against and combined with the
lexical function method proposed by (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). We show
that, by fusing a network-based with a lexical function model, performance
gains can be achieved.
