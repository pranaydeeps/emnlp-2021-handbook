Abstract#==#While reading times are often used to measure working memory load, frequency
effects (such as surprisal or n-gram frequencies) also have strong confounding
effects on reading times. This work uses a naturalistic audio corpus with
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) annotations to measure working memory load during
sentence processing. Alpha oscillations in posterior regions of the brain have
been found to correlate with working memory load in non-linguistic tasks
(Jensen et al., 2002), and the present study extends these findings to working
memory load caused by syntactic center embeddings. Moreover, this work finds
that frequency effects in naturally-occurring stimuli do not significantly
contribute to neural oscillations in any frequency band, which suggests that
many modeling claims could be tested on this sort of data even without
controlling for frequency effects.
