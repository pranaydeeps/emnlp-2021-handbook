Abstract#==#The ``uniform information density'' (UID) hypothesis proposes that language
producers aim for a constant rate of information flow within a message, and
research on monologue-like written texts has found evidence for UID in
production.  We consider conversational messages, using a large corpus of
tweets, and look for UID behavior.  We do not find evidence of UID behavior,
and even find context effects that are opposite that of previous,
monologue-based research.  We propose that a more collaborative conception of
information density and careful consideration of channel noise may be needed in
the information-theoretic framework for conversation.
