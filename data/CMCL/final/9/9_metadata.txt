Abstract#==#While several data sets for evaluating thematic
fit of verb-role-filler triples exist, they do not
control for verb polysemy. Thus, it is unclear
how verb polysemy affects human ratings of
thematic fit and how best to model that. We
present a new dataset of human ratings on high
vs. low-polysemy verbs matched for verb frequency,
together with high vs. low-frequency
and well-fitting vs. poorly-fitting patient role-fillers.
Our analyses show that low-polysemy
verbs produce stronger thematic fit judgements
than verbs with higher polysemy. Role-filler
frequency, on the other hand, had little
effect on ratings. We show that these results
can best be modeled in a vector space using a
clustering technique to create multiple prototype
vectors representing different “senses” of
the verb.
