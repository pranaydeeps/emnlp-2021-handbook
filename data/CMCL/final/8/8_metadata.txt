Abstract#==#Linguistic alignment, such as lexical and syntactic alignment, is a universal
phenomenon influencing dialogue participants in online conversations. Besides
linguistic alignment, social support, such as emotional support and
informational support, also provides important benefits to their members. More
recently, identifying and analyzing social support facilitated insights in the
construction of support oriented communities. In this paper, we study whether
members show pragmatic alignment on social support. While adaptation can occur
at lexical, syntactic and pragmatic levels, relationships between alignments at
multiple levels are neither theoretically nor empirically well understood. Our
results indicate pragmatic alignment of forum members along the axis of support
type. We also find that lexical alignment is correlated with emotional support,
and that the amount of lexical alignment is also correlated with the amount of
pragmatic alignment.  This finding can contribute to improving our
understanding about the linguistic signature of different types of support, and
enhancing theoretical model of the Interactive Alignment Model in a multi-party
peer support conversation context.
