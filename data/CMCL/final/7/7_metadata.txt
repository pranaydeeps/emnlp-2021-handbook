Abstract#==#Linguistic alignment has emerged as an important property of conversational
language and a driver of mutual understanding in dialogue. While various
computational measures of linguistic alignment in corpus and experimental data
have been devised, a systematic evaluation of them is missing. In this study,
we first evaluate the sensitivity and distributional properties of three
measures, indiscriminate local linguistic alignment (LLA), Spearmanâ€™s
correlation coefficient (SCC), and repetition decay (RepDecay). Then we apply
them in a study of interactive alignment and individual differences to see how
well they conform to the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM), and how well they
can reveal the individual differences in alignment propensity. Our results
suggest that LLA has the overall best performance.
