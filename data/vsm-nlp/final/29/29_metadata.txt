Abstract#==#In this paper we compare the performance
of three approaches for estimating the la-
tent weights of terms for scientific docu-
ment summarization, given the document and
a set of citing documents. The first ap-
proach is a TF (term-frequency) vector space
method utilizing a non-negative matrix fac-
torization (NNMF) for dimensionality reduc-
tion. The other two are language modeling ap-
proaches used to predict the term distributions
of human-generated summaries. The docu-
ment is summarized by developing a language
model that exploits the key sections of the
document and a set of citing sentences from
documents that cite the document of interest.
The language model parameters may be set
via a minimization of the Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence. We use the OCCAMS algorithm
(Optimal Combinatorial Covering Algorithm
for Multi-document Summarization) to select
a set of sentences that maximizes the top-
ics coverage score. The results are evaluated
using standard ROUGE metrics and the per-
formance of the resulting methods achieves
ROUGE scores exceeding those of the aver-
age human summarizer.
