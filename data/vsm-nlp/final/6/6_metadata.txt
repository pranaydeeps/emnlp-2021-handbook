Abstract#==#Word sense induction (WSI) is the problem of automatically building an
inventory of senses for a set of target words using only a text corpus. We
introduce a new method for embedding word instances and their context, for use
in WSI. The method, Instance-context embedding (ICE), leverages neural word
embed- dings, and the correlation statistics they cap- ture, to compute high
quality embeddings of word contexts. In WSI, these context embeddings are
clustered to find the word senses present in the text. ICE is based on a novel
method for combining word embeddings using continuous Skip-gram, based on both
semantic and a temporal aspects of context words. ICE is evaluated both in a
new system, and in an extension to a previous system for WSI. In both cases, we
surpass previous state-of-the-art, on the WSI task of SemEval-2013, which
highlights the generality of ICE. Our proposed system achieves a 33% relative
improvement.
