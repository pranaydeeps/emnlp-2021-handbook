Abstract#==#In this paper a different machine learning approach is presented to deal with
the coreference resolution task. This approach consists of a multi-classifier
system that classifies mention-pairs in a reduced dimensional vector space. The
vector representation for mention-pairs is generated using a rich set of
linguistic features. The SVD technique is used to generate the reduced
dimensional vector space. 

The approach is applied to the OntoNotes v4.0 Release Corpus for the
column-format files used in CONLL-2011 coreference resolution shared task. The
results obtained show that the reduced dimensional representation obtained by
SVD is very adequate to appropriately classify mention-pair vectors. Moreover,
we can state that the multi-classifier plays an important role in improving the
results.
