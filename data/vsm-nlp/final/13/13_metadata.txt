Abstract#==#We present a method for the detection and representation of polysemous nouns, a
phenomenon that has received little attention in NLP. The method is based on
the exploitation of the semantic information preserved in Word Embeddings. We
first prove that polysemous nouns instantiating a particular sense alternation
form a separate class when clustering nouns in a lexicon. Such a class,
however, does not include those polysemes in which a sense is strongly
predominant. We address this problem and present a sense index that, for a
given pair of lexical classes, defines the degree of membership of a noun to
each class: polysemy is hence implicitly represented as an intermediate value
on the continuum between two classes. We finally show that by exploiting the
information provided by the sense index it is possible to accurately detect
polysemous nouns in the dataset
