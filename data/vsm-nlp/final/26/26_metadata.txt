Abstract#==#This paper presents a case study of using distributed word representations,
  \texttt{word2vec} in particular, for improving performance of Named Entity
  Recognition for the e-Commerce domain. We also demonstrate that
  distributed word representations trained on a smaller amount of in-domain
  data are more effective than word vectors trained on very large amount of
  out-of-domain data, and that their combination gives the best results.
