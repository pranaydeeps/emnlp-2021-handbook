Abstract#==#We present an ad hoc concept modeling approach using distributional semantic
models to identify fine-grained entities and their relations in an online
search setting. Concepts are generated from user-defined seed terms,
distributional evidence, and a relational model over concept distributions. A
dimensional indexing model is used for efficient aggregation of distributional,
syntactic, and relational evidence. The proposed semi-supervised model al-lows
concepts to be defined and related at varying levels of granularity and scope.
Qualitative evaluations on medical records, intelligence documents, and open
domain web data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
