Abstract#==#We propose a novel approach to learning dis-
tributed representations of variable-length text
sequences in multiple languages simultane-
ously. Unlike previous work which often de-
rive representations of multi-word sequences
as weighted sums of individual word vec-
tors, our model learns distributed representa-
tions for phrases and sentences as a whole.
Our work is similar in spirit to the recent
paragraph vector approach but extends to the
bilingual context so as to efficiently encode
meaning-equivalent text sequences of multi-
ple languages in the same semantic space.
Our learned embeddings achieve state-of-the-
art performance in the often used crosslingual
document classification task (CLDC) with an
accuracy of 92.7 for English to German and
91.5 for German to English. By learning
text sequence representations as a whole, our
model performs equally well in both classifi-
cation directions in the CLDC task in which
past work did not achieve.
