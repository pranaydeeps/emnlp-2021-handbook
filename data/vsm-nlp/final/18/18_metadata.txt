Abstract#==#Recent interest in distributed vector representations for words has resulted in
an increased diversity of approaches, each with strengths and weaknesses. We
demonstrate how diverse vector representations may be inexpensively composed
into hybrid representations, effectively leveraging strengths of individual
components, as evidenced by substantial improvements on a standard word analogy
task. We further compare these results over different sizes of training sets
and find these advantages are more pronounced when training data is limited.
Finally, we explore the relative impacts of the differences in the learning
methods themselves and the size of the contexts they access.
