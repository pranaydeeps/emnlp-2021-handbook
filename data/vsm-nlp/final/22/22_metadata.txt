Abstract#==#Matrix factorization of knowledge bases in universal schema has facilitated
accurate distantly-supervised relation extraction. This factorization encodes
dependencies between textual patterns and structured relations using
low-dimensional vectors defined for each entity pair; although these factors
are effective at combining evidence for an entity pair, they are inaccurate on
rare pairs, or for relations that depend crucially on the entity types. On the
other hand, tensor factorization is able to overcome these shortcomings when
applied to link prediction by maintaining entity-wise factors. However these
models have been unsuitable for universal schema. In this paper we first
present an illustration on synthetic data that explains the unsuitability of
tensor factorization to relation extraction with universal schemas. Since the
benefits of tensor and matrix factorization are complementary, we then
investigate two hybrid methods that combine the benefits of the two paradigms.
We show that the combination can be fruitful: we handle ambiguously phrased
relations, achieve gains in accuracy on real-world relations, and demonstrate
that entity embeddings encode entity types.
