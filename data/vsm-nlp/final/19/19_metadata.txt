Abstract#==#Vector representations for language has been shown to be useful in a number of
Natural Language Processing tasks. In this paper, we aim to investigate the
effectiveness of word vector representations for the problem of Aspect Based
Sentiment Analysis. In particular, we target three sub-tasks namely aspect term
extraction, aspect category detection, and aspect sentiment prediction. We
investigate the effectiveness of vector representations over different text
data and evaluate the quality of domain-dependent vectors. We utilize vector
representations to compute various vector-based features and conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate their effectiveness. Using simple vector based
features, we achieve F1 scores of 79.91% for aspect term extraction, 86.75% for
category detection, and the accuracy 72.39% for aspect sentiment prediction.
