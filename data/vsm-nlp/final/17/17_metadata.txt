Abstract#==#We present the architecture of a deep learning pipeline for natural language
processing. Based on this architecture we built a set of tools both for
creating distributional vector representations and for performing specific NLP
tasks. Three methods are available for creating embeddings: feed-forward neural
network, sentiment specific embeddings and embeddings based on counts and
Hellinger PCA. Two methods are provided for training a network to perform
sequence tagging, a window approach and a convolutional approach. The window
approach is used for implementing a POS tagger and a NER tagger, the
convolutional network is used for Semantic Role Labeling. The library is
implemented in Python with core numerical processing written in C++ using
parallel linear algebra library for efficiency and scalability
