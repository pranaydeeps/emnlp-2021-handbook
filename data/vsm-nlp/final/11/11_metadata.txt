Abstract#==#Graph-based dependency parsing algorithms commonly employ features up to third
order in an attempt to capture richer syntactic relations. However, each level
and each feature combination must be defined manually. Besides that, input
features are usually represented as huge, sparse binary vectors, offering
limited generalization. In this work, we present a deep architecture for
dependency parsing based on a convolutional neural network. It can examine the
whole sentence structure before scoring each head/modifier candidate pair, and
uses dense embeddings as input. Our model is still under ongoing work,
achieving 91.6% unlabeled attachment score in the Penn Treebank.
