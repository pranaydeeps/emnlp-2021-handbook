Abstract#==#Word embeddings have recently proven useful in a number of different
applications that deal with natural language. Such embeddings succinctly
reflect semantic similarities between words based on their sentence-internal
contexts in large corpora. In this paper, we show that information extraction
techniques provide valuable additional evidence of semantic relationships that
can be exploited when producing word embeddings. We propose a joint model to
train word embeddings both on regular context information and on more explicit
semantic extractions. The word vectors obtained from such an augmented joint
training show improved results on word similarity tasks, suggesting that they
can be useful in applications that involve word meanings.
