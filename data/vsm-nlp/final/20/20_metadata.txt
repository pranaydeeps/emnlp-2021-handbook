Abstract#==#We explore new methods of improving Curriculum Vitae (CV) parsing for German
documents by applying recent research on the application of word embeddings in
Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our approach integrates the word embeddings
as input features for a probabilistic sequence labeling model that relies on
the Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. Best-performing word embeddings
are generated from a large sample of German CVs. The best results on the
extraction task are obtained by the model which integrates the word embeddings
together with a number of hand-crafted features. The improvements are
consistent throughout different sections of the target documents. The effect of
the word embeddings is strongest on semi-structured, out-of-sample data.
