Abstract#==#Traditional supervised learning approaches to common NLP tasks depend heavily
on manual annotation, which is labor intensive and time consuming, and often
suffer from data sparseness. In this paper we show how to mitigate the problems
in short text classification (STC) through word embeddings â€“ distributional
representations of words learned from large unlabeled data. The word embeddings
are trained from the entire English Wikipedia text. We assume that a short text
document is a specific sample of one distribution in a Bayesian framework. A
Gaussian process approach is used to model the distribution of words. The task
of classification becomes a simple problem of selecting the most probable
Gaussian distribution. This approach is compared with those based on the
classical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) approach. Our approach achieved better performance and also showed
advantages in dealing with unseen words.
