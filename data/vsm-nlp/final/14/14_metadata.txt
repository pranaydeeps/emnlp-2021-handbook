Abstract#==#We tackle the question: how much supervision is needed to achieve
state-of-the-art performance in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, if we leverage
lexical representations given by the model of Brown et al. (1992)? It has
become a standard practice to use automatically induced "Brown clusters" in
place of POS tags. We claim that the underlying sequence model for these
clusters is particularly well-suited for capturing POS tags. We empirically
demonstrate this claim by drastically reducing supervision in POS tagging with
these representations. Using either the bit-string form given by the algorithm
of Brown et al. (1992) or the (less well-known) embedding form given by the
canonical correlation analysis algorithm of Stratos et al. (2014), we can
obtain 93% tagging accuracy with just 400 labeled words and achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy (> 97%) with less than 1 percent of the original
training data.
