Abstract#==#We replicate the syntactic experiments of Mikolov et al. on English, and expand
them to include morphologically complex languages. We learn vector
representations for Dutch, French, German, and Spanish with the WORD2VEC tool,
and investigate to what extent inflectional information is preserved across
vectors. We observe that the accuracy of vectors on a set of syntactic
analogies is inversely correlated with the morphological complexity of the
language.
