Abstract#==#Up to now, relation extraction systems have made extensive use of features
generated by linguistic analysis modules. Errors in these features lead to
errors of relation detection and classification. In this work, we depart from
these traditional approaches with complicated feature engineering by
introducing a convolutional neural network for relation extraction that
automatically learns features from sentences and minimizes the dependence on
external toolkits and resources. Our model takes advantages of multiple window
sizes for filters and pre-trained word embeddings as an initializer on a
non-static architecture to improve the performance. We                         
emphasize
the
relation
extraction problem with an unbalanced corpus. The experimental results show
that our system significantly outperforms not only the best baseline systems
for relation extraction but also the state-of-the-art systems for relation
classification.
