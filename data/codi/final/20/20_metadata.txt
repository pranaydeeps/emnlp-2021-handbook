Abstract#==#We present a novel corpus of more than 400 human- and computer-generated documents, comprising greater than 20,000 clauses, annotated for clause types and coherence relations that allow for nuanced comparison of artificial and natural discourse modes. The corpus covers both formal and informal discourse, and contains computer generations from some of the latest text-generating algorithms such as Grover (Zellers et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). We showcase the usefulness of the corpus for detailed discourse analysis of text generation by providing evidence that various coherence relation shortcomings are associated with lower perceived quality of computer-generated narratives and arguments.
