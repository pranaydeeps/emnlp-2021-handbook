Abstract#==#We present a domain-independent clustering-based approach for automatic
extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs). The method combines statistical
information from a general-purpose corpus and texts from Wikipedia articles. We
incorporate association measures via dimensions of data points to cluster MWEs
and then compute the ranking score for each MWE based on the closest exemplar
assigned to a cluster. Evaluation results, achieved for two languages, show
that a combination of association measures gives an improvement in the ranking
of MWEs compared with simple counts of co-occurrence frequencies and purely
statistical measures.
