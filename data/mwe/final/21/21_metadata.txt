Abstract#==#We present a novel approach for the identification of multiword expressions
(MWEs). The methodology extracts a large set of recurring syntactic fragments
from a given treebank using a Tree-Kernel method. Differently from previous
studies, the expressions underlying these fragments are arbitrarily long and
can include intervening gaps. In the initial study we use these fragments to
identify MWEs as a parsing task (in a supervised manner) as proposed by Green
et al. (2011). Here we obtain a small improvement over previous results. In the
second part, we compare various association measures in reranking the
expressions underlying these fragments in an unsupervised fashion. We show how
a newly defined measure (Log Inside Ratio) based on statistical parsing
techniques is able to outperform classical association measures in the French
data.
