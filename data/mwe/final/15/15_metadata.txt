Abstract#==#Scarcity of multiword expression data sets raises a fundamental challenge to
evaluating the systems that deal with these linguistic structures. In this work
we attempt to address this problem for a subclass of multiword expressions by
producing a large data set annotated by experts and validated by common
statistical measures. We present a set of 1048 noun-noun compounds which are
annotated as non-compositional, compositional, conventionalized and not
conventionalized. We build this data set following common trends in previous
work while trying to address some of the well known issues such as small number
of annotated instances, quality of the annotations, and lack of availability of
true negative instances.
