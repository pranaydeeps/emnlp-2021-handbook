Abstract#==#Verb senses are often assumed to distinguish among different conceptual event
categories. However, senses misrepresent the number of event categories
expressed both within and across languages and event categories may be
“named” by more than a word, i.e. a multi-word expression. Determining the
nature and number of event categories in an event description requires an
understanding of the parameters relevant for categorization. We propose a set
of parameters for use in creating a Gold Standard of event categories and apply
them to a corpus sample of 2000 sentences across 10 verbs. In doing so, we find
an asymmetry between subjects and direct objects in their contributions to
distinguishing event categories. We then explore methods of automating event
categorization to approximate our Gold Standard through the use of hierarchical
clustering and Latent Semantic Analysis.
