Abstract#==#Though the multiword lexicon has long been of interest in computational
linguistics, most relevant work is targeted at only a small portion of it. Our
work is motivated by the needs of learners for more comprehensive resources
reflecting formulaic language that goes beyond what is likely to be codified in
a dictionary. Working from an initial sequential segmentation approach, we
present two important enhancements: the use of a new measure to promote the
identification of lexicalized sequences, and an expansion to include sequences
with gaps. We evaluate using a novel method that allows us to calculate an
estimate of recall without a reference lexicon, showing our good performance
relative to the second enhancement depends crucially on the first, and that our
lexicon conforms much more with human judgment of formulaic language than
alternatives.
