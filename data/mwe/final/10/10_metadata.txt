Abstract#==#Multiword expressions (MWEs) presents particular
and distinctive semantic properties
hence, their automatic extraction receives special
attention from the natural language processing
(NLP) and corpus linguistics community,
and is still an active research area. Unfortunately,
the creation of necessary resources
for this task is quite rigorous and many languages
suffer from the lack of these; as in
the case for Turkish. This study presents
our MWE annotations on recently introduced
Turkish Treebanks, which focuses on annotating
various types of linguistic units and expressions,
including named entities, numerical
expressions, idiomatic phrases, verb phrases
with auxiliaries and duplications. The paper
aims to provide a benchmark and shed light
for further MWE extraction research for Turkish.
To this end, the paper also introduces
our experimental results with seven baseline
approaches, a dependency parser and a previously
introduced rule-based extractor on these
annotated corpora. Our highest performances
achieved over these resources are about 60%
F-scores.
