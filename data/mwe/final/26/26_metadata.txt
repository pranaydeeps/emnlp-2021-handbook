Abstract#==#In this paper, we present the first attempt to integrate predicted
  compositionality scores of multiword expressions into automatic machine
translation
  evaluation, in integrating compositionality scores for English noun
  compounds into the TESLA machine translation evaluation metric. The
  attempt is marginally successful, and we speculate on whether a
  larger-scale attempt is likely to have greater impact.
