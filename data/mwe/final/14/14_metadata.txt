Abstract#==#We argue that many multi-word domain terms are not (and should not be regarded
as)
strictly atomic, especially from a parser's point of view.  We introduce the
notion of
Lexical Kernel Units (LKUs), and discuss some of their essential properties. 
LKUs are
building blocks for lexicalizations of domain concepts, and as such, can be
used for
compositional derivation of an open-ended set of domain terms.              Benefits
from
such an
approach include reduction in size of the domain lexicon, improved coverage for
domain
terms, and improved accuracy for parsing.
