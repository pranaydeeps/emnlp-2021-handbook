Abstract#==#This paper introduces NEMWEL, a system that performs Never-Ending MultiWord
Expressions Learning. Instead of using a static corpus and classifier, NEMWEL
applies supervised learning on automatically crawled news texts. Moreover, it
uses its own results to periodically retrain the classifier, bootstrapping on
its own results. In addition to a detailed description of the system's
architechture and its modules, we report the results of a manual evaluation. It
shows that NEMWEL is capable of learning new expressions over time with
improved precision.
