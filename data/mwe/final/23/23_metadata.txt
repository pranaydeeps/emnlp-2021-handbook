Abstract#==#Multiword expressions (MWEs) are vexing for linguists, psycholinguists and
computational linguists, as they are hard to define, detect and parse. However,
previous studies have not taken into account the cognitive constraints under
which MWEs are produced or comprehended. We present a new modality for studying
MWEs, keystroke dynamics. We ask subjects to respond to a variety of questions,
varying in the level of cognitive demand required to generate an answer. In
each response, a subjectâ€™s pause time preceding each word -- within and
outside an MWE -- can illuminate distinct differences in required effort across
tasks. By taking advantage of high-precision keystroke loggers, we show that
MWEs produced under greater cognitive demands are produced more slowly, at a
rate more similar to free expressions. We hypothesize that increasingly
burdensome cognitive demands diminish the capacity of lexical retrieval, and
cause MWE production to slow.
