Abstract#==#Support-verb constructions (i.e., multiword expressions combining a
semantically light verb with a predicative noun) are problematic for standard
statistical machine translation systems, because SMT systems cannot distinguish
between literal and idiomatic uses of the verb. We work on the German to
English
translation direction, for which the identification of support-verb
constructions is challenging due to the relatively free word order of German.
We show that we achieve improved translation quality for verb-object
supportverb constructions by marking the verbs when occuring in such
constructions. Additional evaluations revealed that our systems produce more
correct verb translations than a contrastive baseline system without verb
markup.
