Abstract#==#The paper describes the results of an empirical study of integrating bigram
collocations and similarities between them and unigrams into topic models.
First of all, we propose a novel algorithm PLSA-SIM that is a modification of
the original algorithm PLSA. It incorporates bigrams and maintains
relationships between unigrams and bigrams based on their component structure.
Then we analyze a variety of word association measures in order to integrate
top-ranked bigrams into topic models. All experiments were conducted on four
text collections of different domains and languages. The experiments
distinguish a subgroup of tested measures that produce top-ranked bigrams,
which demonstrate significant improvement of topic models quality for all
collections, when integrated into PLSA-SIM algorithm.
