Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate whether long- standing literary theories about
nineteenth-century British novels can be verified using computational
techniques. Elson et al. (2010) previously introduced the task of computa-
tionally validating such theories, extracting conversational networks from
literary texts. Revisiting their work, we conduct a closer reading of the
theories themselves, present a revised and expanded set of hypotheses based on
a divergent interpretation of the theories, and widen the scope of networks for
validat- ing this expanded set of hypotheses.
