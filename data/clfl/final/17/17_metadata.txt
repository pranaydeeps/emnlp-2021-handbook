Abstract#==#The analysis of sound and sonic devices in poetry is the focus of much poetic
scholarship, and poetry scholars are becoming increasingly interested in the
role that computation might play in their research. Since the nature of such
sonic analysis is unique, the associated tasks are not supported by standard
text analysis techniques. We introduce a formalism for analyzing sonic devices
in poetry. In addition, we present RhymeDesign, an open-source implementation
of our formalism, through which poets and poetry scholars can explore their
individual notion of rhyme.
