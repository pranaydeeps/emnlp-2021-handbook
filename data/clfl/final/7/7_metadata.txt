Abstract#==#We present a manually annotated word alignment of Franz Kafka's "Verwandlung"
and use this as a controlled test case to assess the principled usefulness of
word alignment as an additional information source for the (monolingually
motivated) identification of literary characters, focusing on the technically
well-explored task of co-reference resolution. This pilot set-up allows
us to illustrate a number of methodological components interacting in a modular
architecture. In general, co-reference resolution is a relatively hard task,
but the availability of word-aligned translations can provide additional
indications, as there is a tendency for translations to explicate
underspecified or vague passages.
