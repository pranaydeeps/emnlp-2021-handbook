Abstract#==#Coreference resolution (CR) is a key task in the automated analysis of
characters in stories. Standard CR systems usually trained on newspaper texts
have difficulties with literary texts, even with novels; a comparison with
newspaper texts showed that average sentence length is greater in novels and
the number of pronouns, as well as the percentage of direct speech is higher.
We report promising evaluation results for a rule-based system similar to [Lee
et al. 2011], but tailored to the domain which recognizes coreference chains in
novels much better than CR systems like CorZu. Rule-based systems performed
best on the CoNLL 2011 challenge [Pradhan et al. 2011]. Recent work in machine
learning showed similar results as rule-based systems [Durett et al. 2013]. The
latter has the advantage that its explanation component facilitates a fine
grained error analysis for incremental refinement of the rules.
