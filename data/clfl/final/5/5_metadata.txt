Abstract#==#We propose an approach to detecting the rhetorical figure called chiasmus,
which involves the repetition of a pair of words in reverse order, as in ``all
for one, one for all''. Although repetitions of words are common in natural
language, true instances of chiasmus are rare, and the question is therefore
whether a computer can effectively distinguish a chiasmus from a random
criss-cross pattern. 
We argue that chiasmus should be treated as a graded phenomenon, which leads to
the design of an engine that extracts all criss-cross patterns and ranks them
on a scale from prototypical chiasmi to less and less likely instances. Using
an evaluation inspired by information retrieval, we demonstrate that our system
achieves an average precision of 61%. As a by-product of the evaluation we also
construct the first annotated corpus of chiasmi.
