Abstract#==#Accessing historical texts is often a challenge because readers either do not
know the historical language, or they are challenged by the technological
hurdle when such texts are available digitally.Merging corpus linguistic
methods and digital technology can provide novel ways of representing
historical texts digitally and providing a simpler access. In this paper, we
describe a multi-dimensional parallel Old Occitan-English corpus, in which
word alignment serves as the basis for search capabilities as well as for the
transfer of annotations.  We show how parallel alignment can help overcome some
challenges of historical manuscripts. Furthermore, we apply a resource-light
method of building an emotion annotation via parallel alignment, thus showing
that such annotations are possible without speaking the historical language.
Finally, using visualization tools, such as ANNIS and GoogleViz, we demonstrate
how the emotion analysis can be queried and visualized dynamically in our
parallel corpus, thus showing that such information can be made accessible with
low technological barriers.
