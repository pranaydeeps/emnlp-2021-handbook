Abstract#==#We study perceptions of literariness in a set of contemporary Dutch novels.
Experiments with machine learning models show that it is possible to
automatically distinguish novels that are seen as highly literary from those
that are seen as less literary, using surprisingly simple textual features. The
most discriminating features of our classification model indicate that genre
might be a confounding factor, but a regression model shows that we can also
explain variation between highly literary novels from less literary ones within
genre.
