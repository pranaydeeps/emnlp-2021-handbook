Abstract#==#Several computational linguistics techniques are applied to analyze a large
corpus of Spanish sonnets from the 16th and 17th centuries. The analysis is
focused on metrical and semantic aspects. First, we are developing a hybrid
scansion system in order to extract and analyze rhythmical or metrical
patterns. The possible metrical patterns of each verse are extracted with
language-based rules. Then statistical rules are used to resolve ambiguities.
Second, we are applying distributional semantic models in order to, on one
hand, extract semantic regularities from sonnets, and on the other hand to
group together sonnets and poets according to these semantic regularities.
Besides these techniques, in this position paper we will show the objectives of
the project and partial results.
