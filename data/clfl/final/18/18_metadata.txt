Abstract#==#This paper introduces a software tool, GutenTag, which is aimed at giving
literary researchers direct access to NLP techniques for the analysis of texts
in the Project Gutenberg corpus. We discuss several facets of the tool,
including the handling of formatting and structure, the use and expansion of
metadata which is used to identify relevant subcorpora of interest, and a
general tagging framework which is intended to cover a wide variety of future
NLP modules. Our hope that the shared ground created by this tool will help
create new kinds of interaction between the computational linguistics and
digital humanities communities, to the benefit of both.
