Abstract#==#Current machine translation (MT) techniques are continuously improving. In
specific areas, post-editing (PE) can enable the production of high-quality
translations relatively quickly. But is it feasible to translate a literary
work (fiction, short story, etc) using such an MT+PE pipeline? This paper
offers an initial response to this question. An essay by the American writer
Richard Powers, currently not available in French, is automatically
translated and post-edited and then revised by non-professional translators. In
addition to presenting experimental evaluation results of the MT+PE pipeline
(MT system used, automatic evaluation), we also discuss the quality of the
translation output from the perspective of a panel of readers (who read the
translated short story in French, and answered a survey afterwards). Finally,
some remarks of the official French translator of R. Powers, requested on this
occasion, are given at the end of this article.
