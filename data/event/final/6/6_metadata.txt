Abstract#==#We present a novel technique to identify emerging or important topics mentioned
on social media. A sudden increase in related posts can indicate an occurrence
of an external event. Assuming that the sequence of posts is a homogeneous
Poisson process, this sudden change can be modeled using the Gamma
distribution. Our Gamma curve fitter is used to return a set of emerging
topics. We demonstrate our algorithm on Twitter data and evaluate empirically
using the Reuters News Archive and manual inspection. Our experimental results
show that our algorithm provides a good picture of the emerging topics
discussed on Twitter.
