Abstract#==#Event identification plays a crucial role in several natural language
processing applica-tions such as information extraction, question answering,
and text analysis. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for analyzing
events, their distribution, and the event men-tions from a corpus of unlabeled
business-based technical documents—a specific genre. In order to infer such
mentions, we analyze the subject-verb-object structure for semi-automatically
extracting several lexical, syn-tactic, and semantic features for each event
mention from the corpus. Extracting event mentions allows us to cast grouping
together the mentions with same features and propose properties leading to the
differences of the specific genre. The obtained results are used for supporting
an event-centered processing level, from an automated machine for pro-cessing
texts.
