Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
of verbs, which can be directly applied to event mention detection task to
classify event types. By using PropStore, a database of relations between
words, our approach disambiguates senses of verbs by utilizing the information
of verbs that appear in similar syntactic contexts. Importantly, the resource
our approach requires is only a word sense dictionary, without any annotated
sentences, or structures and relations between different senses (e.g. WordNet).
Our approach can be extended to disambiguate senses of words in other types of
part-of-speech besides verbs.
