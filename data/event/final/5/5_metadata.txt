Abstract#==#We describe a system for event extraction across documents and languages. We
devel- oped a framework for the interoperable se- mantic interpretation of
mentions of events, participants, locations and time, as well as the relations
between them. Furthermore, we use a common RDF model to represent instances of
events, entities and normalised dates. Within this model, we define events as
the combination of the predicate and its par- ticipants including its location
and time. We convert multiple mentions of the same event in English, Spanish
and Dutch to a single rep- resentation. We thus resolve cross-document event
and entity coreference within a language but also across languages. We tested
our sys- tem on a Wikinews corpus of 120 English ar- ticles that have been
translated to Spanish and Dutch. We report on the cross-lingual cross- document
event and entity extraction compar- ing the Spanish and Dutch output with
respect to English.
