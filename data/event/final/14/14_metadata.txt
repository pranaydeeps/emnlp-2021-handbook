Abstract#==#We propose a taxonomy of contradictory event pairs and a method for building a
database of such pairs. When a dialog system participates in an open-domain
conversation with a human, it is important to avoid the generation of
utterances that conflict with the context of the dialog. Here, we refer to a
pair of events that are not able to co-occur or that are not inconsistent with
each other as a contradictory event pair. In this study, we collected
contradictory event pairs using crowdsourcing and constructed a taxonomy of
such pairs. We also built a large-scale database of Japanese contra- dictory
event pairs for each class using crowdsourcing. This database will be used for
consistent utterance generation in dialog systems.
