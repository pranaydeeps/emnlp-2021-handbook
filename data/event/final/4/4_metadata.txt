Abstract#==#We propose a new kind of event structure representation for computational
linguistics, based on the theoretical framework of First-Phase Syntax
(Ramchand, 2008). We show that the approach not only gives a theoretically
well-motivated set of subevents and related semantic roles, it also posits the
levels of representation needed for analyzing a linguistic phenomenon that has
repeatedly caused problems in computational systems, namely the treatment of
complex predication. In particular, we look at V+V complex predicates in
Urdu/Hindi and show that Ramchand’s subevent decomposition implemented in a
VerbNet-style resource allows for a consistent semantic analysis of these
complex events. We also show how the proposed event representation can be added
to existing resources in the language, in particular the Hindi-Urdu Treebank
and Hindi PropBank.
