Abstract#==#This paper presents a Retrospective Event Detection algorithm, called
Eventy-Topic Detection (ETD), which automatically generates topics that
describe events in a large, temporal text corpus.  Our approach leverages the
structure of the topic modeling framework, specifically the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), to generate topics which are then later labeled as
Eventy-Topics or non-Eventy-Topics.  The system first runs daily LDA topic
models, then calculates the cosine similarity between the topics of the daily
topic models, and then runs our novel Bump-Detection algorithm.  Similar topics
labeled as an Eventy-Topic are then grouped together.  The algorithm is
demonstrated on two Terabyte sized corpuses - a Reuters News corpus and a
Twitter corpus.  Our method is evaluated on a human annotated test set.  Our
algorithm demonstrates its ability to accurately describe and label events in a
temporal text corpus.
