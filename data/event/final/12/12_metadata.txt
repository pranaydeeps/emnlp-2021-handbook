Abstract#==#Causality is an important relation among events and entities. 
Embedded causal structures represent an important class, expressing
complex causal chains; but they are traditionally difficult to uncover
automatically. In this paper we propose a method for the efficient
identification and extraction of embedded causal relations with minimal
supervision, by combining a representation of structured language data with
modified prototype theory specifically suited to the data type. We then utilize
a form of genetic algorithm specifically adapted for our purpose to locate the
likely candidate linguistic structures that contain causal chains. With this
procedure, we were able to identify many embedded structures with complex
causal chains in two corpora of different genres, applying this algorithm as a
ranking procedure for all structures in the data. We obtained 79.5% percision
for top quantiles of both of our datasets (BNC & novels).
