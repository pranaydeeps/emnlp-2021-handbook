Abstract#==#This paper describes the processes and issues of annotating event nuggets based
on DEFT ERE Annotation Guidelines v1.3 and TAC KBP Event Detection Annotation
Guidelines 1.7. Using Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (brat), newswire and
discussion forum documents were annotated. One of the challenges arising from
human annotation of documents is annotators' disagreement about the way of
tagging
events. We propose using Event Nuggets to help meet the definitions of the
specific type/subtypes which are part of this project. We present case studies
of several examples of event annotation issues, including discontinuous
multi-word events representing single events. Annotation statistics and
consistency analysis is provided to characterize the inter-annotator agreement,
considering single term
events and multi-word events which are both continuous and discontinuous.
Consistency analysis is conducted using a scorer to compare first pass
annotated files against adjudicated files.
