Abstract#==#In this paper we show how our semantic parser (Knowledge Parser or K-Parser)
identifies various kinds of event mentions in the input text. The types include
recursive (complex) and non recursive event mentions. K-Parser outputs each
event mention in form of an acyclic graph with root nodes as the verbs that
drive those events. The children nodes of the verbs represent the entities
participating in the events, and their conceptual classes. The on-line demo of
the system is available at http://kparser.org
