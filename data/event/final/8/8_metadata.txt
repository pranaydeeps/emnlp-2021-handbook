Abstract#==#In this paper we propose a scheme for annotating opposition relations among
verb frames in lexical resources. The scheme is tested on the T-PAS resource,
an inventory of typed predicate argument structures for Italian, conceived for
both linguistic research and computational tasks. After discussing opposition
relations from a linguistic point of view and listing the tags we decided to
use, we report the results of the experiment we performed to test the
annotation scheme, in terms of interannotation agreement and linguistic
analysis of annotated data.
