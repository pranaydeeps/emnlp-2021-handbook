Abstract#==#Using clues from event semantics to solve coreference, we present an "event
template" approach to cross-document event coreference resolution on news
articles. The approach uses a pairwise model, in which event information is
compared along five semantically motivated slots of an event template. The
templates, filled in on the sentence level for every event mention from the
data set, are used for supervised classification. 
In this study, we determine granularity of events and we use the grain size as
a clue for solving event coreference. We experiment with a newly-created
granularity ontology employing granularity levels of locations, times and human
participants as well as event durations as features in event coreference
resolution. The granularity ontology is available for research. Results show
that determining granularity along semantic event slots, even on the sentence
level exclusively, improves precision and solves event coreference with scores
comparable to those achieved in related work.
