Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the possibility of unsupervised  Multiple Choices Question Answering (MCQA).
From very basic knowledge, the MCQA model knows that some choices have higher probabilities of being correct than others.
The information, though very noisy, guides the training of an MCQA model.
The proposed method is shown to outperform the baseline approaches on RACE and is even comparable with some supervised learning approaches on MC500.
