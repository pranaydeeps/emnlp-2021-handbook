Abstract#==#Dense retrieval has been shown to be effective for Open Domain Question Answering, surpassing sparse retrieval methods like BM25. 
One such  model, REALM, (Guu et al., 2020) is an end-to-end 
dense retrieval system that uses MLM based pretraining for improved downstream QA
performance. However, the current REALM setup 
uses limited resources and is not comparable in scale to more recent systems, contributing to its lower performance.
Additionally, it relies on noisy supervision for retrieval during fine-tuning.
We propose REALM++, where we improve upon the training and inference setups and introduce better supervision signal for improving performance, without any architectural changes.
REALM++ achieves ~5.5% absolute accuracy gains over the baseline while being faster to train. It also matches the performance of large models which have 3x more parameters demonstrating the efficiency of our setup.
