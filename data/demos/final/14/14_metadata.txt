Abstract#==#We present Brahmi-Net - an online system for transliteration and script
conversion for all major Indian language pairs (306 pairs). The system covers
13 Indo-Aryan languages, 4 Dravidian languages and English. For training the
transliteration systems, we mined parallel transliteration corpora from
parallel translation corpora using an unsupervised method and trained
statistical transliteration systems using the mined corpora. Languages which do
not have a parallel corpora are supported by transliteration through a bridge
language. Our script conversion system supports conversion between all
Brahmi-derived scripts as well as ITRANS romanization scheme. For this, we
leverage co-ordinated Unicode ranges between Indic scripts and use an extended
ITRANS encoding for transliterating between English and Indic scripts. The
system also provides top-k transliterations and simultaneous transliteration
into multiple output languages. We provide a Python as well as REST API to
access these services. The API and the mined transliteration corpus are
made available for research use under an open source license.
