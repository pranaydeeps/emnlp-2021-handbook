Abstract#==#``Deep-syntactic" dependency structures bridge the gap between the
surface-syntactic structures as produced by state-of-the-art dependency parsers
and semantic logical forms in that they abstract away from  surface-syntactic
idiosyncrasies, but still keep the linguistic structure of a sentence.               
     
 They have thus a great potential for such downstream applications as machine
translation and summarization. In this demo paper, we propose an online version
of a deep-syntactic parser that outputs deep-syntactic structures from plain
sentences and visualizes them using the Brat tool. Along with the
deep-syntactic structures, the user can also inspect the visual presentation of
the surface-syntactic structures that serve as input to the deep-syntactic
parser and that are produced by the joint tagger and syntactic transition-based
parser ran in the pipeline before the deep-syntactic parser.
