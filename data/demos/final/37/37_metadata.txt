Abstract#==#Previous systems for natural language questions over complex linked datasets
require the user to enter a complete and well-formed question, and present the
answers as raw lists of entities. Using a feature-based grammar with a full
formal semantics, we have developed a system that is able to support rich
autosuggest, and to deliver dynamically generated analytics for each result
that it returns.
