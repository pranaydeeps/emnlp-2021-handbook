Abstract#==#The RExtractor system is an information extractor that processes input
documents by natural language processing tools and consequently queries the
parsed sentences to extract a knowledge base of entities and their relations.
The extraction queries are designed manually using a tool that enables natural
graphical representation of queries over dependency trees. A workflow of the
system is designed to be language and domain independent. We demonstrate
RExtractor on Czech and English legal documents.
