Abstract#==#In this demonstration, we will present our online parser that allows users to
submit any sentence and obtain an analysis following the specification of AMR
(Banarescu et al., 2014) to a large extent. This AMR analysis is generated by a
small set of rules that convert a native Logical Form analysis provided by a
pre-existing parser into the AMR format. While we demonstrate the performance
of our AMR parser on data sets annotated by the LDC, we will focus attention in
the demo on the following two areas: 1) we will make available AMR annotations
for the data sets that were used to develop our parser, to serve as a
supplement to the LDC data sets, and 2) we will demonstrate AMR parsers for
German, French, Spanish and Japanese that make use of the same small set of
LF-to-AMR conversion rules.
