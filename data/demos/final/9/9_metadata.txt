Abstract#==#We present an open source, freely available Java implementation of Align,
Disambiguate, and Walk (ADW), a state-of-the-art approach for measuring
semantic similarity based on the Personalized PageRank algorithm. A pair of
linguistic items, such as phrases or sentences, are first disambiguated using
an alignment-based disambiguation technique and then modeled using random walks
on the WordNet graph. ADW provides three main advantages: (1) it is applicable
to all types of linguistic items, from word senses to texts; (2) it is
all-in-one, i.e., it does not need any additional resource, training or tuning;
and (3) it has proven to be highly reliable at different lexical levels and
multiple evaluation benchmarks. We are releasing the source code at
https://github.com/pilehvar/adw/. We also provide at
http://lcl.uniroma1.it/adw/ a Web interface and a Java API that can be
seamlessly integrated into other NLP systems requiring semantic similarity
measurement.
