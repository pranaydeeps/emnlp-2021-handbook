Abstract#==#Sociolinguists are regularly faced with the task of measuring phonetic features
from speech, which involves manually transcribing  audio recordings -- a major
bottleneck to analyzing large collections of data.  We harness automatic speech
recognition to build an online end-to-end web application where users upload
untranscribed speech collections and receive formant measurements of the vowels
in their data. We demonstrate this tool by using it to automatically analyze
President Barack Obama's vowel pronunciations.
