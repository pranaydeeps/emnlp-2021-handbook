Abstract#==#Developing machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP)
applications is inherently an iterative process, involving a continuous
refinement of the choice of model, engineering of features, selection of
inference algorithms, search for the right hyper- parameters, and error
analysis. Existing probabilistic program languages (PPLs) only provide partial
solutions; most of them do not support commonly used models such as matrix
factorization or neural networks, and do not facilitate interactive and
iterative programming that is crucial for rapid development of these models.

In this demo we introduce WOLFE, a stack designed to facilitate the development
of NLP applications: (1) the WOLFE language allows the user to concisely define
complex models, enabling easy modification and extension, (2) the WOLFE
interpreter transforms declarative ma- chine learning code into automatically
differentiable terms or, where applicable, into factor graphs that allow for
complex models to be applied to real-world applications, and (3) the WOLFE IDE
provides a number of different visual and interactive elements, allowing
intuitive exploration and editing of the data representations, the underlying
graphical models, and the execution of the inference algorithms.
