Abstract#==#Educational research has demonstrated that asking students to respond to
reflection prompts can increase interaction between instructors and students,
which in turn can improve both teaching and learning especially in large
classrooms. However, administering an instructor's prompts, collecting the
students' responses, and summarizing these responses for both instructors and
students is challenging and expensive. To address these challenges, we have
developed an application called CourseMIRROR (Mobile In-situ Reflections and
Review with Optimized Rubrics).  CourseMIRROR uses a mobile interface to
administer prompts and collect reflective responses for a set of
instructor-assigned course lectures. After collection, CourseMIRROR
automatically summarizes the reflections with an extractive phrase
summarization method, using a clustering algorithm to rank extracted phrases by
student coverage. Finally, CourseMIRROR presents the phrase summary to both
instructors and students to help them understand the difficulties and
misunderstandings encountered.
