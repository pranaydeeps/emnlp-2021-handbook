Abstract#==#We present a syntactic analysis query toolkit geared specifically towards
massive dependency parsebanks and morphologically rich languages. The query
language allows arbitrary tree queries, including negated branches, and is
suitable for querying analyses with rich morphological annotation. Treebanks of
over a million words can be comfortably queried on a low-end netbook, and a
parsebank with over 100M words on a single consumer-grade server. We also
introduce a web-based interface for interactive querying. All contributions are
