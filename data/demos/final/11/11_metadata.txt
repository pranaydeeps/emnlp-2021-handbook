Abstract#==#We describe the design, development, and API for two discourse parsers for
Rhetorical Structure Theory. The two parsers use the same underlying framework,
but one uses features that rely on dependency syntax, produced by a fast
shift-reduce parser, whereas the other uses a richer feature space, including
both constituent- and dependency-syntax and coreference information, produced
by the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit. Both parsers obtain state-of-the-art
performance, and use a very simple API consisting of, minimally, two lines of
Scala code. We accompany this code with a visualization library that runs the
two parsers in parallel, and displays the two generated discourse trees side by
side, which provides an intuitive way of comparing the two parsers.
