Abstract#==#We introduce an interactive interface that aims to help English as a Second
Language (ESL) students overcome language related hindrances while reading a
text. The interface allows the user to find supplementary information on
selected difficult words. The interface is empowered by our lexical
substitution engine that provides context-based synonyms for difficult words.
We also provide a practical solution for a real-world usage scenario. We
demonstrate using the lexical substitution engine -- as a browser extension
that can annotate and disambiguate difficult words on any webpage.
