Abstract#==#We present an interactive web-based writing assistance system that is based on
recent advances in crosslingual compositional distributed semantics.
Given queries in Japanese or English, our system can retrieve semantically
related sentences from high quality English corpora.
By employing crosslingually constrained vector space models to represent
phrases, our system naturally sidesteps several difficulties that would arise
from direct word-to-text matching, and is able to provide novel functionality
like the visualization of semantic relationships between phrases interlingually
and intralingually.
