Abstract#==#We have developed the TextEvaluator system for providing text complexity and
Common Core-aligned readability information. Detailed text complexity
information is provided by eight component scores, presented in such a way as
to aid in the userâ€™s understanding of the overall readability metric, which
is provided as a holistic score on a scale of 100 to 2000. The user may select
a targeted US grade level and receive additional analysis relative to it. This
and other capabilities are accessible via a feature-rich front-end, located at
http://texteval-pilot.ets.org/TextEvaluator/.
