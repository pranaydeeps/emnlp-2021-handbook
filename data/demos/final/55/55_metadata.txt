Abstract#==#This paper presents a multi-strategy and multi-source question answering (QA)
system that can use multiple strategies to both answer natural language (NL)
questions and respond to keywords. We use multiple information sources
including curated knowledge base, raw text, auto-generated triples, and NL
processing results. We develop open semantic answer type detector for answer
merging and improve previous developed single QA modules such as knowledge base
based QA, information retrieval based QA.
