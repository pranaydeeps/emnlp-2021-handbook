Abstract#==#"When reading a literary piece, readers often make inferences about various characters' roles, personalities, relationships, intents, actions, etc.
While humans can readily draw upon their past experiences to build such a character-centric view of the narrative, \textit{understanding} characters in narratives can be a challenging task for machines. To encourage research in this field of character-centric narrative understanding, we present \fiscu \ -- a new dataset of literary pieces and their summaries paired with descriptions of characters that appear in them. We also introduce two new tasks on \fiscu: \textit{Character Identification} and \textit{Character Description Generation}. Our experiments with several pre-trained language models adapted for these tasks demonstrate that there is a need for better models of narrative comprehension."
