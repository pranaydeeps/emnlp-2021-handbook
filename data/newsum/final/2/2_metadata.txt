Abstract#==#The task of document-level text simplification is very similar to summarization with the additional difficulty of reducing complexity.
We introduce a newly collected data set of German texts, collected from the Swiss news magazine 20 Minuten (`20 Minutes') that consists of full articles paired with simplified summaries. 
Furthermore, we present experiments on automatic text simplification with the pretrained multilingual mBART and a modified version thereof that is more memory-friendly, using both our new data set and existing simplification corpora.
Our modifications of mBART let us train at a lower memory cost without much loss in performance, in fact, the smaller mBART even improves over the standard model in a setting with multiple simplification levels.
