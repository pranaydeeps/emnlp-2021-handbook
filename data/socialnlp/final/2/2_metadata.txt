Abstract#==#Machine Translation system accuracies are often brought down due to inaccurate
Language Detection (LD) of input phrases. The Language detection accuracy is
further affected when the inputs are short and contain ungrammatical phrases,
especially in a multilingual mobile game setting. Chat messages in mobile games
are often short as they are typed on mobile devices and contain slang as a
common communication preference. Previous work has shown that LD systems have a
drop in accuracy when the inputs are short messages instead of long ones. This
paper targets LD for short chat messages in mobile games. We propose a novel LD
system which integrates text-based and user-based methods to achieve
significantly better performance over current state-of-the-art LD systems.
