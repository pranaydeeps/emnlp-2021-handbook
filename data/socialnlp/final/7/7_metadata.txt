Abstract#==#Paraphrase Identification and Semantic Similarity are two different yet well
related tasks in NLP. There are many studies on these two tasks extensively on
structured texts in the past. However, with the strong rise of social media
data, studying these tasks on unstructured texts, particularly, social texts in
Twitter is very interesting as it could be more com- plicated problems to deal
with. We investigate and find a set of simple features which enables us to
achieve very competitive performance on both tasks in Twitter data.
Interestingly, we also confirm the significance of using word alignment
techniques from evaluation metrics in machine translation in the overall
performance of these tasks.
