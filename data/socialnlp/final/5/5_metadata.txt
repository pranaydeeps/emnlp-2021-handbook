Abstract#==#One way in which marketers gain insights about consumers is by identifying the
occasions in which consumers use their products and which are invoked by their
products. Identifying occasions helps in consumer segmentation,  answering why
consumers purchase a product, and  where and when they use it. Additionally,
the types of occasions a consumer participates in and the social settings
surrounding those occasions provide insights into the consumer's personality
and sociocultural self. Insights such as these are required for understanding
consumer behavior, which marketers need to better design and sell their
products.  In this paper, we describe a methodology for extracting and
categorizing occasions from product reviews, product descriptions, and forum
posts. We examine using a maximum entropy markov model (MEMM) and a linear
chain conditional random field (CRF) for extraction and find the CRF results in
a 72.4% F1-measure. Extracted occasions are categorized as one of six
high-level types (Celebratory, Special, Seasonal, Temporal, Weather-Related,
and Other) using a support vector machine with an 88.5% macro-averaged
F1-measure.
