Abstract#==#As the volume of documents on the Web increases,
technologies to extract useful information from them become
increasingly essential. For instance, information extracted from social network
services such as Twitter and Facebook is useful because it
contains a lot of location-specific information. To
extract such information, it is necessary to identify the location of
each location-relevant expression within a document. Previous
studies on location disambiguation have tackled this problem on the basis of
word sense disambiguation, and did not make use of location-specific clues.
In this paper, we propose a method for location disambiguation that takes
advantage of
the following two clues: spatial proximity and temporal consistency.
We confirm the effectiveness of these clues through experiments on Twitter
tweets with GPS information.
