Abstract#==#Metaphor is a cognitive phenomenon exhibited in language, where one conceptual
domain (the target) is thought of in terms of another (the source). The first
level of metaphor interpretation is the mapping of linguistic metaphors to
pairs of source and target concepts. Based on the abductive approach to
metaphor interpretation proposed by Hobbs (1992) and implemented in the
open-source Metaphor-ADP system (Ovchinnikova et al., 2014), we present work to
automatically learn knowledge bases to support high-precision conceptual
metaphor mapping in English, Spanish, Farsi, and Russian
