Abstract#==#This paper describes a system that makes use of a repository of formalized
frames and metaphors to automatically detect, categorize, and analyze
expressions of metaphor in corpora.  The output of this system can be used as a
basis for making further refinements to the system, as well as supporting deep
semantic analysis of metaphor expressions in corpora. This in turn provides a
way to ground and test empirical conceptual metaphor theory, as well as serving
as a means to gain insights into the ways conceptual metaphors are expressed in
language.
