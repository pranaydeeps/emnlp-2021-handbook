Abstract#==#Metaphor is a central phenomenon of language, and thus a central problem for
natural language understanding. Previous work on the analysis of metaphors has
identified which target concepts are being thought of and described in terms of
which source concepts, but this is not adequate to explain what motivates the
use of particular metaphors. This work proposes the use of conceptual schemas
to represent the underspecified scenarios that motivate a metaphoric mapping.
To support the creation of systems that can understand metaphors in this way,
we have created and are publicly releasing a corpus of manually validated
metaphor annotations.
