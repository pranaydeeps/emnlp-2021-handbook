Abstract#==#Accurate metaphor detection remains an open challenge. In this paper, we
explore a new type of clue for disambiguating terms that may be used
metaphorically or literally in an online medical support community. In
particular, we investigate the influence of situational factors, specifically
the experience of stressful illness-related events in a poster's recent
history, on propensity to employ the metaphorical sense of words when they can
be used to illustrate the emotion behind the experience of the event.  We
evaluate the positive impact of automatically extracted cancer events on a
metaphor detection task using data from an online cancer forum.  We also
provide a discussion of specific associations between events and metaphors,
such as journey with diagnosis or warrior with chemotherapy.
