Abstract#==#Language is the main communication device to represent the environment and
share a common              understanding of the world that we perceive through our
sensory
organs. Therefore, each language might contain a great amount of sensorial
elements to express the perceptions both in literal and figurative usage. To
tackle the semantics of figurative language, several conceptual properties such
as concreteness or imegeability are utilized. However, there is no attempt in
the literature to analyze and benefit from the sensorial elements for
figurative language processing. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
sensorial features on metaphor identification. We utilize an existing lexicon
associating English words to sensorial modalities and propose a novel technique
to automatically discover these associations from a dependency-parsed corpus.
In our experiments, we measure the contribution of the sensorial features to
the metaphor identification task with respect to a state of the art model. The
results demonstrate that sensorial features yield better performance and show
good generalization properties.
