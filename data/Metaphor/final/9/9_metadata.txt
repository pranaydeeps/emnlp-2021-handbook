Abstract#==#We present a supervised machine learning system for word-level classification
of all content words in a running text as being metaphorical or
non-metaphorical. The system provides a substantial improvement upon a
previously published baseline, using re-weighting of the training examples and
using features derived from a concreteness database. We observe that while the
first manipulation was very effective, the second was only slightly so.
Possible reasons for these observations are discussed.
