Abstract#==#Concreteness and imageability have long been held to play an important role in
the meanings of Ô¨Ågurative expressions. Recent work has implemented this idea
in order to detect metaphors in natural language discourse. Yet, metaphor is a
rich linguistic resource, the import of which we are only just starting to
understand, and like most aspects of natural language,it also involves
affective meanings. We aim to demonstrate in this paper corpus-based and
computational techniques for modelling the interactions between the underlying
conceptual dimensions of metaphorical meaning and more social meanings like
sentiment, and how doing so improves performance in such tasks as automatic
detection of metaphor in discourse, and also in turn points to how we might
better understand the complex models built to account for such interactions.
