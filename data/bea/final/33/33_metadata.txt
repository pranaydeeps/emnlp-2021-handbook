Abstract#==#Marking student responses to short answer questions raises particular issues
for human markers, as well as for automatic marking systems. In this paper we
present the Amati system, which aims to help human markers improve the speed
and accuracy of their marking. Amati supports an educator in incrementally
developing a set of automatic marking rules, which can then be applied to
larger question sets or used for automatic marking. We show that using this
system allows markers to develop mark schemes which closely match the
judgements of a human expert, with the benefits of consistency, scalability and
traceability afforded by an automated marking system. We also consider some
difficult cases for automatic marking, and look at some of the computational
and linguistic properties of these cases.
