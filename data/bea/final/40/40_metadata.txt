Abstract#==#This paper presents an investigation of score prediction for the Organization
dimension of an assessment of analytical writing in response to text. With the
long-term goal of producing feedback for students and teachers, we designed a
task-dependent model that aligns with the scoring rubric and makes use of the
source material. Our experimental results show that our rubric-based model
performs as well as baselines on datasets from grades 6-8. On shorter and
noisier essays from grades 5-6, the rubric-based model performs better than the
baselines. Further, we show that the baseline model (lexical chaining) can be
improved if we extend it with information from the source text for shorter and
noisier data.
