Abstract#==#A key aspect of cognitive diagnostic models is the specification of the
Q-matrix associating the items and some underlying student attributes. In many
data-driven approaches, test items are mapped to the underlying, latent
knowledge components (KC) based on observed student performance, and with
little or not input from human experts. As a result, these latent skills
typically focus on modeling the data accurately, but may be hard to describe
and interpret. In this paper, we focus on the problem of describing these
knowledge components. Using a simple probabilistic model, we extract, from the
text of the test items, some keywords that are most relevant to each KC. On a
small dataset from the PSLC datashop, we show that this is surprisingly
effective, retrieving unknown skill labels in close to 50% of cases. We also
show that our method clearly outperforms typical baselines in specificity and
diversity.
