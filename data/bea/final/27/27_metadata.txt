Abstract#==#We present the Jinan Chinese Learner Corpus, a large collection of L2 Chinese
texts produced by learners that can be used for educational tasks. The present
work introduces the data and provides a detailed description. Currently, the
corpus contains approximately 6 million Chinese characters written by students
from over 50 different L1 backgrounds. This is a large-scale corpus of learner
Chinese texts which is freely available to researchers either through a web
interface or as a set of raw texts. The data can be used in NLP tasks including
automatic essay grading, language transfer analysis and error detection and
correction. It can also be used in applied and corpus linguistics to support
Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research and the development of pedagogical
resources. Practical applications of the data and future directions are
discussed.
