Abstract#==#We introduce a novel framework based on the probabilistic model for emotion
wording assistance. The example sentences from the on-line dictionary,
Vocabulary.com are utilized as the training data; and the writings in a
designed ESL’s writing task are the testing cor-pus. The emotion events are
captured by extracting patterns of the example sentences. Our approach learns
the joint probability of contextual emotion events and the emotion words from
the training corpus. After extracting patterns in the testing corpus, we then
aggregate their probabilities to suggest the emotion word that describes the
ESL’s context most appropriately. We evaluate the proposed approach by the
NDCG@5 of the suggested words for the writings in the testing corpus. The
experiment result shows our approach can more appropriately suggest the
emotion words compared to SVM, PMI and two representative on-line reference
tools, PIGAI and Thesaurus.
