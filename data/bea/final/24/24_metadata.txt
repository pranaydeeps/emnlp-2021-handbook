Abstract#==#The task of Native Language Identification (NLI) is typically solved with
machine learning methods, and systems make use of a wide variety of features.
Some preliminary studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of
individual features, however, no systematic study of feature interaction has
been carried out. We propose a function to measure feature independence and
analyze its effectiveness on a standard NLI corpus.
