Abstract#==#This paper identifies computational challenges in restructuring encyclopedic
resources (like Wikipedia or thesauri) to reorder concepts with the goal of
helping learners navigate through a concept network without getting trapped in
circular dependencies between concepts. We present approaches that can help
content authors identify regions in the concept network, that after editing,
would have maximal impact in terms of enhancing the utility of the resource to
learners.
