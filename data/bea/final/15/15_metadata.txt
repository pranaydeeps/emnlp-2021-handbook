Abstract#==#In this work, we investigate whether the analysis
of opinion expressions can help in scoring
persuasive essays. For this, we develop systems
that predict holistic essay scores based on
features extracted from opinion expressions,
topical elements, and their combinations. Experiments
on test taker essays show that essay
scores produced using opinion features are indeed
correlated with human scores. Moreover,
we find that combining opinions with their targets
(what the opinions are about) produces
the best result when compared to using only
opinions or only topics.
