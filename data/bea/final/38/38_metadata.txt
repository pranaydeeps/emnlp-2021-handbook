Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel approach to error correction in content words in
learner writing focussing on adjective–noun (AN) combinations. We show how
error patterns can be used to improve the performance of the error correction
system, and demonstrate that our approach is capable of suggesting an
appropriate correction within the top two alternatives in half of the cases and
within top 10 alternatives in 71% of the cases, performing with an MRR of
0.5061. We then integrate our error correction system with a state-of-the-art
content word error detection system and discuss the results.
