Abstract#==#This paper explores the annotation and classification of students' revision
behaviors in argumentative writing. A  sentence-level revision schema is
proposed to capture why and how students make revisions. Based on the proposed
schema, a small corpus of student essays and revisions was annotated. Studies
show that manual annotation is reliable with the schema and the annotated
information  helpful for revision analysis. Furthermore, features and methods
are explored for the automatic classification of revisions. Intrinsic
evaluations demonstrate promising performance in high-level revision
classification (surface vs. text-based). Extrinsic evaluations demonstrate that
our method for automatic revision classification can be used to predict a
writer's improvement.
