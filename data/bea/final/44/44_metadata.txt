Abstract#==#A quasi-experimental study compared the effects of feedback condition on
eighth-grade students’ writing motivation and writing achievement. Four
classes of eighth-graders were assigned to a combined feedback condition in
which they received feedback on their writing from their teacher and from an
automated essay evaluation (AEE) system called PEGWriting®. Four other
eighth-grade classes were assigned to a teacher feedback condition, in
which they solely received feedback from their teacher via GoogleDocs. Results
indicated that students in the combined PEGWriting+Teacher Feedback condition
received feedback more quickly and indicated that they were more likely to
solve problems in their writing. Equal writing quality was achieved between
feedback groups even though teachers in the PEGWriting condition spent less
time providing feedback to students than in the GoogleDocs condition. Results
suggest that PEGWriting enabled teachers to offload certain aspects of the
feedback process and promoted greater independence and persistence for
students.
