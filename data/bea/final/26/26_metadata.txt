Abstract#==#Automated scoring of student essays is increasingly used to reduce manual
grading effort. State-of-the-art approaches use supervised machine learning
which makes it complicated to transfer a system trained on one task to another.
We investigate which currently used features are task-independent and evaluate
their transferability on English and German datasets. We find that, by using
our task-independent feature set, models transfer better between tasks. We also
find that the transfer works even better between tasks of the same type.
