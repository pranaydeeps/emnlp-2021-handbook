Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe a morphological analyzer for learner Hungarian,
built upon limited grammatical knowledge of Hungarian. The rule-based analyzer
requires very few resources and is flexible enough to do both morphological
analysis and error detection, in addition to some unknown word handling.  As
this is work-in-progress, we demonstrate its current capabilities, some areas
where analysis needs to be improved, and an initial foray into how the system
output can support the analysis of interlanguage grammars.
