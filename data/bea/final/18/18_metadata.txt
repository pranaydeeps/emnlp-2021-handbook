Abstract#==#This paper describes RevUP which deals with automatically generating gap-fill
questions. RevUP consists of 3 parts: Sentence Selection, Gap Selection \&
Multiple Choice Distractor Selection. To select topically-important sentences
  from texts, we propose a novel sentence ranking method based on topic
distributions obtained from topic models. To select gap-phrases from each
selected sentence, we collected human annotations, using the Amazon Mechanical
Turk, on the relative relevance of candidate gaps. This data is used to train a
discriminative classifier to predict the relevance of gaps, achieving an
accuracy of 81.0\%. Finally, we propose a novel method to choose distractors
that are semantically similar to the gap-phrase and have contextual fit to the
gap-fill question. By crowd-sourcing the evaluation of our method through the
Amazon Mechanical Turk, we found that 94\% of the distractors selected were
good. RevUP fills the semantic gap left open by previous work in this area, and
represents a significant step towards automatically generating quality tests
for teachers and self-motivated learners.
