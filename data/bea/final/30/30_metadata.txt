Abstract#==#Automated scoring of short answers often involves matching a studentâ€™s
response against one or more sample reference texts. Each reference text
provided contains very specific instances of correct responses and may not
cover the variety of possibly correct responses. Finding or hand-creating
additional references can be very time consuming and expensive. In order to
overcome this problem we propose a technique to generate alternative reference
texts by summarizing the content of top-scoring student responses. We use a
graph-based cohesion technique that extracts the most representative answers
from among the top-scorers. We also use a state-of-the-art extractive
summarization tool called MEAD. The extracted set of responses may be used as
alternative reference texts to score student responses. We evaluate this
approach on short answer data from Semeval 2013's Joint Student Response
Analysis task.
