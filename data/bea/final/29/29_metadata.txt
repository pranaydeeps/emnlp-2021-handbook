Abstract#==#We examine different ensemble methods, including an oracle, to estimate the
upper limit of classification accuracy for Native Language Identification
(NLI). The oracle outperforms state-of-the-art systems by over 10% and results
indicate that for many misclassified texts the correct class label receives a
significant portion of the ensemble votes, often being the runner-up.  We also
present a pilot study of human performance for NLI, the first such experiment.
While some participants achieve modest results on our simplified setup with
5 L1s, they did not outperform our NLI system, and this performance gap is
likely to widen on the standard NLI setup.
