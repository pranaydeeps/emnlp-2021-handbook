Abstract#==#Language proficiency tests are a useful tool for evaluating learner progress,
if the test difficulty fits the level of the learner. In this work, we describe
a generalized framework for test difficulty prediction that is applicable to
several languages and test types. In addition, we develop two ranking
strategies
for candidate evaluation inspired by automatic solving methods based on
language model probability and semantic relatedness. These ranking strategies
lead to significant improvements for the difficulty prediction of cloze tests.
