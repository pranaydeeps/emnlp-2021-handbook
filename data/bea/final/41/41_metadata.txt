Abstract#==#We present a log-linear ranking model for interpreting questions in a virtual
patient dialogue system and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms a
more typical multiclass classifier model using the same information. The full
model makes use of weighted and concept-based matching features that together
yield a 15% error reduction over a strong lexical overlap baseline. The
accuracy of the
ranking model approaches that of an extensively handcrafted pattern matching
system, promising to reduce the authoring burden and make it possible to use
confidence estimation in choosing dialogue acts; at the same time, the
effectiveness of the concept-based features indicates that manual development
resources can be productively employed with the approach in developing concept
hierarchies.
