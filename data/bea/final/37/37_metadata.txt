Abstract#==#The goal of the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing (AESW) Shared Task
is to analyze the linguistic characteristics of scientific writing to promote
the development of automated writing evaluation tools that can assist authors
in writing scientific papers. The proposed task is to predict whether a given
sentence requires editing to ensure its "fit" with the scientific writing
genre. We describe the proposed task, training, development, and test data
sets, and evaluation metrics.
