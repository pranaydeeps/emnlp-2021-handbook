Abstract#==#Parallel corpora are constructed by taking a document authored in one language
and translating it into another language. However, the information about the
authored and translated sides of the corpus is usually not preserved. When
available, this information can be used to improve statistical machine
translation. Existing statistical methods for translation direction detection
have low accuracy when applied to the realistic out-of-domain setting,
especially when the input texts are short. Our contributions in this work are
three fold: 1) We develop a multi-corpus parallel dataset with translation
direction labels at the sentence level, 2) we perform a comparative evaluation
of previously introduced features for translation direction detection in a
cross-domain setting and 3) we generalize a previously introduced type of
features to outperform the best previously proposed features in detecting
translation direction and achieve 0.80 precision with 0.85 recall.
