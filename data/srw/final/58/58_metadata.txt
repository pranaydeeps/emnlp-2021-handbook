Abstract#==#This paper presents a machine learning system that uses dependency-based
features and lexical features for recognizing textual entailment. The system
first generates a frame-based structured representation of the sentences using
dependency relations obtained from Stanford Dependency parser. This structured
representation is then used to evaluate a set of lexical and syntactic
features. These features are simple and intuitive; easy to comprehend and
evaluate. The system evaluates the feature values automatically without any
manual effort or intervention. The performance of the proposed system is
evaluated by performing experiments on RTE1, RTE2 and RTE3 datasets. Decision
trees are found to outperform other classifiers while SVM classifier using an
RBF kernel shows comparable performance. Additionally, a comparative study of
the current system with other ML-based systems for RTE to check the performance
of the proposed system is also carried out. The dependency-based heuristics and
lexical features from the current system have resulted in significant
improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-art ML-based solutions for RTE.
A task-based analysis of the current system for RTE1 dataset is also performed
which, shows improved performance as compared to similar study performed by
different researchers in the past.
