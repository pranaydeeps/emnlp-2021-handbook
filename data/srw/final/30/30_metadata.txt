Abstract#==#In this thesis proposal we present a novel semantic embedding method, which
aims at consistently performing semantic clustering at sentence level. Taking
into account special aspects of Vector Space Models (VSMs), we propose to learn
reproducing kernels in classification tasks. By this way, capturing spectral
features from data is possible. These features make it theoretically plausible
to model semantic similarity criteria in Hilbert spaces, i.e. the embedding
spaces. We could improve the semantic assessment over embeddings, which are
criterion-derived representations from traditional semantic vectors. The
learned kernel could be easily transferred to clustering methods, where the
Multi-Class Imbalance Problem is considered (e.g. semantic clustering of
definitions of terms).
