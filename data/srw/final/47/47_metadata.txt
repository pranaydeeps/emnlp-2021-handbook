Abstract#==#Discourse markers (DMs) are ubiquitous cohesive
devices used to connect what is said
or written. However, across languages there
is divergence in their usage, placement, and
frequency, which is considered to be a major
problem for machine translation (MT). This
paper presents an overview of a proposed thesis,
exploring the difficulties around DMs in
MT, with a focus on Chinese and English.
The thesis will examine two main areas: modelling
cohesive devices within sentences and
modelling discourse relations (DRs) across
sentences. Initial experiments have shown
promising results for building a prediction
model that uses linguistically inspired features
to help improve word alignments with respect
to the implicit use of cohesive devices, which
in turn leads to improved hierarchical phrase based
MT.
