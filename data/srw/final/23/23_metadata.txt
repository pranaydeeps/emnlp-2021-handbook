Abstract#==#Most of the work in sentiment analysis and opinion mining focuses on extracting
explicit sentiments. Opinions may be expressed implicitly via inference rules
over explicit sentiments. In this thesis, we incorporate the inference rules as
constraints in joint prediction models, to develop an entity/event-level
sentiment analysis system which aims at detecting both explicit and implicit
sentiments expressed among entities and events in the text, especially focusing
on but not limited to sentiments toward events that positively or negatively
affect entities (+/-effect events).
