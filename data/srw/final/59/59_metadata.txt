Abstract#==#The aim of this thesis proposal is to perform bilingual lexicon extraction for
cases in which small parallel corpora are available and it is not easy to
obtain monolingual corpus for at least one of the languages. Moreover, the
languages are typologically distant and there is no bilingual seed lexicon
available. We focus on the language pair Spanish-Nahuatl, we propose to work
with morpheme based representations in order to reduce the sparseness and to
facilitate the task of finding lexical correspondences between a highly
agglutinative language and a fusional one. We take into account contextual
information but instead of using a precompiled seed dictionary, we use the
distribution and dispersion of the positions of the morphological units as cues
to compare the contextual vectors and obtaining the translation candidates.
