Abstract#==#Community question answering (CQA) websites contain millions of question and
answer (QnA) pairs that represent real users' interests. Traditional methods
for relation extraction from natural language text operate over individual
sentences. However answer text is sometimes hard to understand without knowing
the question, \eg it may not name the subject or relation of the question. This
work presents a novel model for relation extraction from CQA data, which uses
discourse of QnA pairs to predict relations between entities mentioned in
question and answer sentences. Experiments on 2 publicly available datasets
demonstrate that the model can extract from ~20% to ~40% additional relation
triples, not extracted by existing sentence-based models.
