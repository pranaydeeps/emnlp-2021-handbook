Abstract#==#Traditional approaches to Sentiment Analysis (SA) rely on large annotated data
sets or wide-coverage sentiment lexica, and as such often perform poorly on
under-resourced languages. This paper presents empirical evidence of an
efficient SA approach using freely available machine translation (MT) systems
to translate Arabic tweets to English, which we then label for sentiment using
a state-of-the-art English SA system. We show that this approach significantly
outperforms a number of standard approaches on a gold-standard heldout data
set, and performs equally well compared to more cost-intense methods with 76%
accuracy. This confirms MT-based SA as a cheap and effective alternative to
building a fully fledged SA system when dealing with under-resourced languages.
