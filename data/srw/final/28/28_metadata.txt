Abstract#==#The well related tasks of evaluating the Semantic Textual Similarity and
Semantic Relatedness have been under a special attention in NLP community. Many
different approaches have been proposed, implemented and evaluated at different
levels, such as lexical similarity, word/string/POS tags overlapping, semantic
modeling (LSA, LDA), etc. However, at the level of syntactic structure, it is
not clear how significant it contributes to the overall accuracy. In this
paper, we make a preliminary evaluation of the impact of the syntactic
structure in the tasks by running and analyzing the results from several
experiments regarding to how syntactic structure contributes to solving the
tasks.
