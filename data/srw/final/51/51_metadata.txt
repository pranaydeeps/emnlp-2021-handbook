Abstract#==#Document classification and topic models are useful tools for managing and
understanding large corpora. Topic models are used to uncover underlying
semantic and structure of document collections. Categorizing large collection
of documents requires hand-labeled training data, which is time consuming and
needs human expertise. We believe engaging user in the process of document
labeling helps reduce annotation time and address user needs. We present an
interactive tool for document labeling. We use topic models to help users in
this procedure. Our preliminary results show that users can more effectively
and efficiently apply labels to documents using topic model information.
