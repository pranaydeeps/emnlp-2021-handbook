Abstract#==#In the present situation, where every day we come across one or the other
crime, it is of prime importance to ensure ones safety. Any measure which could
ensure ones safety is certain to pay for itself.
An automated system which can suggest the safest path between any two locations
in the city avoiding crime prone areas will be of utmost importance for the
society. In this paper, we propose a method to find the safest path between two
locations, based on the geographical
model of crime intensities. We consider the police records and news articles
for finding crime density of different areas of the city.
It is essential to consider news articles as there is a significant delay in
updating police crime records. We address this problem by updating the crime
intensities based on current news feeds. Based on the updated crime
intensities, we identify the safest path. It is this real time updation of
crime intensities which makes our model way better than the models that are
presently in use.  Our model would also inform the user of crime sprees and
spurt of crimes in a particular area thereby ensuring that user avoids these
crime hot spots.
