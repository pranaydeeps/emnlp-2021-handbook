Abstract#==#This paper describes work in progress to use clustering to create a lexicon of
words that engage in the lexico-semantic relationship known as grading. While
other resources like thesauri and taxonomies exist detailing relationships such
as synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy, we do not know of any thorough resource
for grading. This work focuses on identifying the words that may participate in
this relationship, paving the way for the creation of a true grading lexicon
later.
