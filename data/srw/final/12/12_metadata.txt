Abstract#==#Our thesis proposal aims at integrating word similarity measures in pattern
ranking for relation extraction bootstrapping algorithms. We note that although
many contributions have been done on pattern ranking schemas, few explored the
use of word-level semantic similarity. Our hypothesis is that word similarity
would allow better pattern comparison and better pattern ranking, resulting in
less semantic drift commonly problematic in bootstrapping algorithms. In this
paper, as a first step into this research, we explore different pattern
representations, various existing pattern ranking approaches and some word
similarity measures. We also present a methodology and evaluation approach to
test our hypothesis.
