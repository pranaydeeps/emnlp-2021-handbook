Abstract#==#Many languages, like English, lack a future tense, which makes the automatic
identification of future reference a challenge. In this research we extend
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for use in the identification of future
referring sentences. Building off a set of hand designed rules, we trained a
ADAGRAD classifier to be able automatically detect sentences referring to the
future. Uni-bi-trigram and syntactic rule mixed feature was found to provide
the highest accuracy. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) indicated the existence
of four major categories future orientation. Lastly, the results of these
analyses were found to correlate with a range of behavioral measures, offering
evidence in support of the psychological reality of the categories.
