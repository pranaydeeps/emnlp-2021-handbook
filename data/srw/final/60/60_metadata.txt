Abstract#==#This thesis explores the computational structure of morphological paradigms
from the perspective of unsupervised learning. Three topics are studied: (i)
stem identification, (ii) paradigmatic similarity, and (iii) paradigm
induction. All the three topics progress in terms of the scope of data in
question. The first and second topics explore structure when morphological
paradigms are given, first within a paradigm and then across paradigms. The
third topic asks where morphological paradigms come from in the first place,
and explores strategies of paradigm induction from child-directed speech. This
research is of interest to linguists and natural language processing
researchers, for both theoretical questions and applied areas.
