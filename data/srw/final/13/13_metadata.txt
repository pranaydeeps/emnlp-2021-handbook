Abstract#==#We propose a way to automatically improve
the annotation of verbal complex predicates in
PropBank which until now has been treating
language mostly in a compositional manner.
In order to minimize the manual re-annotation
effort, we build on the recently introduced
concept of aliasing complex predicates to existing
PropBank rolesets which encompass the
same meaning and argument structure. We
suggest to find aliases automatically by applying
a multilingual distributional model that
uses the translations of simple and complex
predicates as features. Furthermore, we set
up an annotation effort to obtain a frequency
balanced, realistic test set for this task. Our
method reaches an accuracy of 44% on this
test set and 72% for the more frequent test
items in a lenient evaluation, which is not far
from the upper bounds from human annotation.
