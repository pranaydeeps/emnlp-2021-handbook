Abstract#==#This paper suggests an architectural approach of representing knowledge graph
for complex question-answering. There are four kinds of entity relations added
to our knowledge graph: syntactic dependencies, semantic role labels, named
entities, and coreference links, which can be effectively applied to answer
complex questions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how our knowledge
graph can be used to solve complex questions such as arithmetics. Our
experiment shows a promising result on solving arithmetic questions, achieving
the 3-folds cross-validation score of 71.75%.
