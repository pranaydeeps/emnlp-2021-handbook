Abstract#==#A challenge for targeted sentiment analysis is that most datasets are domain-specific and thus building supervised models for a new target domain requires substantial annotation effort. Domain adaptation for this task has two dimensions: the nature of targets and the opinion words used to describe sentiment towards the target. We present a data sampling strategy informed by domain differences across these two dimensions with the goal of selecting a small number of examples, thereby minimizing annotation effort. This obtains performance in the 86-100% range compared to the full supervised model using only ~4-15% of the full training data.
