Abstract#==#A single scientific concept can be described in many different ways, and the most informative
description depends on the audience. In this paper, we propose generating personalized scientific
concept descriptions that are tailored to the userâ€™s expertise and context. We outline a complete
architecture for the task and release an expert-annotated resource, ACCoRD, which includes
2360 labeled extractions and 1309 hand-authored concept descriptions for the key first step of
extracting and generating multiple distinct descriptions of a concept in terms of different reference
concepts. Our results show that existing models are not suitable for our task and that our
extractive model substantially outperforms these baselines.
