Abstract#==#The exponential growth in the scientific literature in recent years has lead to a serious scholarly
information overload on researchers. Automatically identifying the specific contribution made
in a research paper would help quicker comprehension of the work, faster literature survey, comparison
with the related works, etc. Here in this work, we propose a method to automatically
extract the contribution statements from research articles. We design a model (ContriSci) multitask
deep neural network leveraging section identification and citance classification of scientific
statements to predict whether a given scientific sentence specifies a contribution or not. Our
long-term goal, we create a knowledge graph of scientific contributions for machine comprehension
and more straightforward navigation of research contributions for a particular domain.
Our proposed model achieves the best performance over earlier methods (a relative improvement
of 8.08% in terms of F1 score) for contributing sentence identification over a dataset of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) papers.
