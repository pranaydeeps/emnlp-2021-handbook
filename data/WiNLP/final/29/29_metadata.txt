Abstract#==#The identification of child predators in chat rooms has been a concerning issue for a long time. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in internet usage and thus, an increase in the incidents of child exploitation. Hence, there is an urgent requirement to develop a system that can protect children from sexual exploitation. In this work, we propose a BERT-based approach to the early detection of child predators using the PAN'12 dataset. Our methodology makes use of a minimum number of dialogues and is able to identify child predators in chats within 45 minutes. An extensive comparison against other deep learning methods suited to text classification tasks and qualitative analysis makes the case for our proposed methodology.
