Abstract#==#We present a study demonstrating how parents' self-described birthing experiences on Reddit significantly changed during COVID-19. Our results indicate that hospital policies may be reflected in birthing narratives. Our work presents a case study in how we can analyze patient experience from their own written narratives and perspectives.
