Abstract#==#This paper uses domain-specific data extracted from publicly available posts on social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter, to analyze and provide insight into the various psychosocioeconomic
(Schmidt and Willis, 2007) factors that affect domestic violence survivors and contribute to their
reluctance to leave abusive relationships. We propose a methodology that employs an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and natural language processing to extract abstractive topics from
a large corpus of unstructured text. Further, we determine the distribution of these factors across
the psychosocioeconomic spectrum and provide a few recommendations for policymakers based
on the results of our analysis.
