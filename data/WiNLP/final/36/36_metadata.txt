Abstract#==#As the use of Natural Language Processing systems increases, there is a need to address
the gender bias in these systems. While research is being done in the English language
to quantify and eliminate bias, it is not the same for Indic Languages. Most Indic
languages are gendered, i.e., each noun is assigned a gender. Therefore, evaluation differs
from what is done in English. In this paper, we evaluate and find occupational bias
in Indic languages. We prepare a dataset of gender neutral occupations and gendered
occupation pairs, in Hindi and Marathi.
