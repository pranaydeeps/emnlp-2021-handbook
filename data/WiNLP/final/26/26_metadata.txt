Abstract#==#Availability of language technology benefits the value of the language and its existence on the digital platform, especially for minoritized languages. This paper introduces equipping a less-resourced Indian language called Manipuri (locally known as Meiteilon) with its first available ALBERT model that we call EM ALBERT (EM stands for "Ema-lon Manipuri," which translates to "our mother language Manipuri"). EM ALBERT will be made available for use to the NLP community.
