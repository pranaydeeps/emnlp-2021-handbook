Abstract#==#An idiom is a phrase or expression that typically presents a figurative, non-literal meaning attached to the words. Processing idioms is essential because it influences natural language processing applications, such as intelligent assistants and machine translation. Users still need to change how they communicate with intelligent assistants intentionally, and scripts are translated without context differences of idioms in many machine translators. This research proves that the named entity recognition approach is applicable for idiom extraction with reliable scores. The average F1 scores of the model with an English idiomatic expressions corpus are over 0.96, and it is expected to enhance researches of idioms and examine extraction methods for practical uses.
