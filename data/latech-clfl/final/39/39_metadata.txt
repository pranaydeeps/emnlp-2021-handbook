Abstract#==#Tracing the influence of individuals or groups
in social networks is an increasingly popular
task in sociolinguistic studies. While methods
to determine someone’s influence in shortterm
contexts (e.g., social media, on-line political
debates) are widespread, influence in longterm
contexts is less investigated and may be
harder to capture. We study the diffusion of
scientific terms in an English diachronic scientific
corpus, applying Hawkes Processes to
capture the role of individual scientists as "influencers"
or "influencees" in the diffusion of
new concepts. Our findings on two major
scientific discoveries in chemistry and astronomy
of the 18th century reveal that modelling
both the introduction and diffusion of scientific
terms in a historical corpus as Hawkes Processes
allows detecting patterns of influence
between authors on a long-term scale.
