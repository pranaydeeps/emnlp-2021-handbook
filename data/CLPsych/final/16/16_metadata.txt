Abstract#==#Quantitative analysis of clinical language samples is a powerful tool for
assessing and screening developmental language impairments, but requires
extensive manual transcription, annotation, and calculation, resulting in
error-prone results and clinical underutilization. We describe a system that
performs automated morphological analysis needed to calculate statistics such
as the mean length of utterance in morphemes (MLUM), so that these statistics
can be computed directly from orthographic transcripts. Estimates of MLUM
computed by this system are closely comparable to those produced by manual
annotation. Our system can be used in conjunction with other automated
annotation techniques, such as maze detection. This work represents an
important first step towards increased automation of language sample analysis,
and towards attendant benefits of automation, including clinical greater
utilization and reduced variability in care delivery.
