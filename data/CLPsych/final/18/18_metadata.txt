Abstract#==#Many significant challenges exist for the mental health field, but one in
particular is a lack of data available to guide research. Language provides a
natural lens for studying mental health â€“ much existing work and therapy have
strong linguistic components, so the creation of a large, varied,
language-centric dataset could provide significant grist for the field of
mental health research. We examine a broad range of mental health conditions in
Twitter data by identifying self-reported statements of diagnosis. We
systematically explore language differences between ten conditions with respect
to the general population, and to each other. Our aim is to provide guidance
and a roadmap for where deeper exploration is likely to be fruitful.
