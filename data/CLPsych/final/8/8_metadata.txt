Abstract#==#The use of language to convey emotional experience is of significant importance
to the process of psychotherapy, the diagnosis of problems with emotion and
memory, and more generally to any communication that aims to evoke a feeling in
the recipient.              Bucci's theory of the referential process (1997) concerns
three
phases whereby a person activates emotional, or bodily experience (Arousal
Phase), conveys the images and events associated with it (Symbolizing Phase),
and reconsiders them (Reorganizing Phase). The Symbolizing Phase is the major
focus of this study and is operationalized by a measure called referential
activity (RA) based on judges' ratings of the concreteness, specifcity, clarity
and imagery of language style.              Computational models of RA have
previously been
created in several languages, however, due to the complexity of modeling RA,
different modeling strategies have been employed for each language and common
features that predict RA across languages are not well understood.  Working
from previous computational models developed in English and Italian, this study
specifies a new model of predictors common to both languages that correlates
between r = .36 and.45 with RA.  The components identified support the
construct validity of the referential process and may facilitate the
development of measures in other languages.
