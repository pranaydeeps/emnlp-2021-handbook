Abstract#==#Restrictive and repetitive behavior (RRB) is a core symptom of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and are manifest in language. Based on this, we expect children
with autism to talk about fewer topics, and more repeatedly, during their
conversations. We thus hypothesize a higher semantic overlap ratio between
dialogue turns in children with ASD compared to those with typical development
(TD). Participants of this study include children ages 4-8, 44 with TD and 25
with ASD without language impairment. We apply several semantic similarity
metrics to the children's dialogue turns in semi-structured conversations with
examiners. We find that children with ASD have significantly more semantically
overlapping turns than children with TD, across different turn intervals. These
results support our hypothesis, and could provide a convenient and robust
ASD-specific behavioral marker.
