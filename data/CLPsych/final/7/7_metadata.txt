Abstract#==#Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an efficacioustreatment for substance use
disorders and other problem behaviors (Lundahl and Burke, 2009). However,
little is known about the specific mechanisms that drive therapeutic change. A
growing body of research has focused on coding within-session language to
better understand how therapist and patient language mutually influence each
other and predict successful (or unsuccessful) treatment outcomes. These
studies typically use human raters, requiring considerable financial, time, and
training costs for conducting such research. This paper describes the
development and testing of a recursive neural network (RNN) model for rating
78,977 therapist and patient talk turns across 356 MI sessions. We assessed the
accuracy of RNNs in predicting human ratings for client speech and compared
them to standard n gram models. The RNN model showed improvement over ngram
models for some codes, but overall, all of the models performed well below
human reliability, demonstrating the difficulty of the
task.
