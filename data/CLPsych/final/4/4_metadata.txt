Abstract#==#Background: Verbal fluency tasks, which require producing as many words in
response to a cue in a fixed time, are widely used within clinical
neuropsychology and in neuropsychological research. Although semantic word
lists can be elicited, typically only the number of words related to the cue is
interpreted thus ignoring any structure in the word sequences. Automated
language techniques can provide a much needed framework for extracting and
charting useful semantic relations in healthy individuals and understanding how
cortical disorders disrupt these knowledge structures and the retrieval of
information from them.
Methods: One minute, animal category verbal fluency tests from 150 participants
consisting of healthy individuals, patients with schizophrenia, and patients
with bipolar disorder were transcribed. We discuss the issues involved in
building and evaluating semantic frameworks and developing robust features to
analyze this data. Specifically we investigate a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
semantic space to obtain semantic features, such as pairwise semantic
similarity and clusters.
Results and Discussion: An in-depth analysis of the framework is presented, and
then results from two measures based on LSA semantic similarity illustrate how
these automated techniques provide additional, clinically useful information
beyond word list cardinality.
