Abstract#==#Mental illnesses, such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
are highly underdiagnosed globally. Populations sharing similar demographics
and personality traits are known to be more at risk than others. In this study,
we characterise the language use of users disclosing their mental illness on
Twitter. Language-derived personality and demographic estimates show
surprisingly strong performance in distinguishing  users that tweet a diagnosis
of depression or PTSD from random controls, reaching an area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve -- AUC -- of around .8 in all our
binary classification tasks. In fact, when distinguishing users disclosing
depression from those disclosing PTSD, the single feature of estimated age
shows nearly as strong performance (AUC = .806) as using thousands of topics
(AUC =.819) or tens of thousands of n-grams (AUC =.812). We also find that
differential language analyses, controlled for demographics, recover many
symptoms associated with the mental illnesses in the clinical literature.
