Abstract#==#Describing troubling events and images and reflecting on their emotional
meanings are central components of most psychotherapies. The computer system
described here tracks the occurrence and intensity of narration or imagery
within transcribed therapy sessions and over the course of treatments; it
likewise tracks the extent to which language denoting appraisal and logical
thought occurs. The Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP) is a computer
text analysis system that uses several dictionaries, including the Weighted
Referential Activity Dictionary (WRAD), designed to detect verbal communication
of emotional images and events, and the Reflection Dictionary (REF), designed
to detect verbal communication denoting cognitive appraisal, as well as other
dictionaries. For each dictionary and each turn of speech, DAAP uses a moving
weighted average of dictionary weights, together with a fold-over procedure, to
produce a smooth density function that graphically illustrates the rise and
fall of each underlying psychological variable. These density functions are
then used to produce several new measures, including measures of the vividness
of descriptions of images or events, and a measure of the extent to which
descriptions of events or images and reflection on their meaning occur
separately.
