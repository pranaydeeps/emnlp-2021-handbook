Abstract#==#This paper proposes neural networks for integrating
compositional and non-compositional
sentiment in the process of sentiment composition,
a type of semantic composition that optimizes
a sentiment objective. We enable individual
composition operations in a recursive
process to possess the capability of choosing
and merging information from these two types
of sources. We propose our models in neural
network frameworks with structures, in which
the merging parameters can be learned in a
principled way to optimize a well-defined objective.
We conduct experiments on the Stanford
Sentiment Treebank and show that the
proposed models achieve better results over
the model that lacks this ability.
