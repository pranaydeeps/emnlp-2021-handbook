Abstract#==#We describe a topic model based approach for selectional preference. Using the
topic features generated by an LDA model on the extracted predicate-arguments
over the Chinese Gigaword corpus, we show improvement to our state-of-the-art
Chinese SRL system by 2.34 F1 points on arguments of nominal predicates, 0.40
F1 point on arguments of verb predicates, and 0.66 F1 point overall. More over,
similar gains were achieved on out-of- genre test data, as well as on English
SRL using the same technique.
