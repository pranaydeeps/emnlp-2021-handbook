Abstract#==#An English entity linking workflow is presented, which combines the
annotations of five public open source entity linking services. The annotations
are
combined through a weighted voting scheme inspired by the ROVER method, which
had not been previously tested on entity linking outputs. The combined results
improved
over each individual system’s results, as evaluated on four different golden
sets.
