Abstract#==#Named entity disambiguation is the task of linking entity mentions
  to their intended referent, as represented in a Knowledge Base,
  usually derived from Wikipedia. In this paper, we combine local
  mention context and global hyperlink structure from Wikipedia in a
probabilistic
  framework. We test our method in eight datasets, improving the
  state-of-the-art results in five. Our results show that the two
  models of context, namely, words in the context and
  hyperlink pathways to other entities in the context,
  are complementary. Our results are not tuned to any of the datasets,
  showing that it is robust to out-of-domain scenarios, and that
  further improvements are possible.
