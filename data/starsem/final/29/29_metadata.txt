Abstract#==#Recently, there has been renewed interest in semantic dependency parsing, among
which one of the paradigms focuses on parsing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 
Consideration of the decoding problem in natural language semantic dependency
parsing as finding a maximum spanning DAG of a weighted directed graph carries
many complexities.  In particular, the computational complexity (and
approximability) of the problem has not been addressed in the literature to
date.  This paper helps to fill this gap, showing that this general problem is
\textsf{APX}-hard, and is \textsf{NP}-hard even under the planar restriction,
in the graph-theoretic sense.  On the other hand, we show that under the
restriction of projectivity, the problem has a straightforward $O(n^3)$
algorithm. We also give some empirical evidence of the algorithmic importance
of these graph restrictions, on data from the SemEval 2014 task 8 on Broad
Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing.
