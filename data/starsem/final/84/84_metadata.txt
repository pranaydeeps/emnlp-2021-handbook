Abstract#==#With the increasing automation of health care information processing, it has
become crucial to extract meaningful information from textual notes in
electronic medical records. One of the key challenges is to extract and
normalize entity mentions. State-of-the-art approaches have focused on the
recognition of entities that are explicitly mentioned in a sentence. However,
clinical documents often contain phrases that indicate the entities but do not
contain their names. We term those implicit entity mentions and introduce the
problem of implicit entity recognition (IER) in clinical documents. We propose
a solution to IER that leverages entity definitions from a knowledge base to
create entity models, projects sentences to the entity models and identifies
implicit entity mentions by evaluating semantic similarity between sentences
and entity models. The evaluation with 857 sentences selected for 8 different
entities shows that our algorithm outperforms the most closely related
unsupervised solution. The similarity value calculated by our algorithm proved
to be an effective feature in a supervised learning setting, helping it to
improve over the baselines, and achieving F1 scores of .81 and .73 for
different classes of implicit mentions. Our gold standard annotations are made
available to encourage further research in the area of IER.
