Abstract#==#Complex interactions among the meanings of words are important factors in the
function that maps word  meanings to phrase meanings. Recently, compositional
distributional semantics models (CDSM) have been designed with the goal of
emulating these complex interactions; however, experimental results on the
effectiveness of CDSM have been difficult to interpret because the current
metrics for assessing them do not control for the confound of lexical
information. We present a new method for assessing the degree to which CDSM
capture semantic interactions that dissociates the influences of lexical and
compositional information.
We then provide a dataset for performing this type of assessment and use it to
evaluate six compositional   models using both co-occurrence based and neural
language model input vectors. Results show that neural
language input vectors are consistently superior to co-occurrence based
vectors, that several CDSM capture substantial compositional information, and
that, surprisingly, vector addition matches and is in many cases superior to
purpose-built paramaterized models.
