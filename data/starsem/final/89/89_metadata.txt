Abstract#==#This paper addresses the question of how document classifiers can
  exploit implicit information about document similarity to improve
  document classifier accuracy. We infer document similarity using
  simple n-gram overlap, and demonstrate that this improves overall
  document classification performance over two datasets. As part of
  this, we find that collective classification based on simple iterative
  classifiers outperforms the more complex and computationally-intensive
  dual classifier approach.
