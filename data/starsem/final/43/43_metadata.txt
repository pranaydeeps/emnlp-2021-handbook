Abstract#==#Annotation efforts have resulted in the availability of a number of corpora
with rhetorical relation information. The corpora, unfortunately, are annotated
under different theoretical approaches and have different hierarchies of
relations. In addition, new sets of rhetorical relations have been proposed to
account for language variation. The types of relations, however, tend to
overlap or be related in specific ways. We believe that differences across
approaches are minimal, and a unified set of relations that works across
languages is possible. This paper details a new taxonomy of relations organized
in four top level-classes  with a total of 26 relations. 
We propose a mapping between existing annotations and show that our taxonomy is
robust across theories, and can be applied to multiple languages.
