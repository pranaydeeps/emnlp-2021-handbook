Abstract#==#This research describes the development of a supervised classifier of English
Caused Motion Constructions (CMCs) (e.g. The goalie kicked the ball into the
field). Consistent identification of CMCs is a necessary step to a correct
interpretation of semantics for sentences where the verb does not conform to
the expected semantics of the verb (e.g. The crowd laughed the clown off the
stage). We expand on a previous study on the classification CMCs (Hwang et al.,
2010) to show that CMCs can be successfully identified in the corpus data. In
this paper, we present the classifier and the series of experiments carried out
to improve its performance.
