Abstract#==#A major problem in research on Textual Entailment (TE) is the high
implementation effort for TE systems. Recently, interoperable standards for
annotation and preprocessing have been proposed. In contrast, the algorithmic
level remains unstandardized, which makes component re-use in this area very
difficult in practice. In this paper, we introduce multi-level alignments as a
central, powerful representation for TE algorithms that encourages modular,
reusable, multilingual algorithm development. We demonstrate that a pilot
open-source implementation of multi-level alignment with minimal features
competes with state-of-the-art open-source TE engines in three languages.
