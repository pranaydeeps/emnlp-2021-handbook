Abstract#==#The automatic induction of scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) from text has
been the focus of many recent works. Most statistical approaches have focused
on open-domain script acquisition, in which a large number of scripts may be
learned, but the acquisition of any particular set of scripts is not
guaranteed. For many specialized applications, however, knowledge of a few
relevant scripts may be more useful than knowledge of many irrelevant scripts.
In this paper, we employ a variety of known script-learning methods to learn
Schank and Abelson’s canonical restaurant script, using a novel dataset of
restaurant narratives we have compiled from a website called “Dinners from
Hell.” Our models learn narrative chains, script-like structures that we
evaluate with the “narrative cloze” task (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008). Our
results suggest that applying these techniques to a domain-specific dataset may
be a reasonable way to learn domain-specific scripts.
