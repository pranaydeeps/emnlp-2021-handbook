Abstract#==#The Practical Lexical Function model (PLF) is a recently proposed
  compositional distributional semantic model which provides an
  elegant account of composition, striking a balance between
  expressiveness and robustness and performing at the
  state-of-the-art.

  In this paper, we identify an inconsistency in PLF between the objective
function
  at training and the prediction at testing which leads to an over-counting of
the predicate's
  contribution to the meaning of the phrase. We investigate two possible
solutions
  and find that one solution (exclusion of simple lexical vector at test time)
  significantly improves performance on two out of the three
  composition datasets.
