Abstract#==#This paper proposes a method of incrementally constructing semantic
representations. Our method is based on Steedman's Combinatory Categorial
Grammar (CCG), which has a transparent correspondence between the syntax and
semantics. In our method, a derivation for a sentence is constructed in an
incremental fashion and the corresponding semantic representation is derived
synchronously. Our method uses normal form CCG derivation. This is the
difference between our approach and previous ones. Previous approaches use most
left-branching derivation called incremental derivation, but they cannot
process coordinate structures incrementally. Our method overcomes this problem.
