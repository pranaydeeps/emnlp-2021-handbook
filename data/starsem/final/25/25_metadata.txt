Abstract#==#Implicit semantic role labeling, the task of retrieving locally unrealized
arguments from wider discourse context, is a knowledge-intensive task. At the
same time, the annotated corpora that exist are all small and scattered across
different annotation frameworks, genres, and classes of predicates. Previous
work has treated these corpora as incompatible with one another, and has
concentrated on
optimizing the exploitation of single corpora. In this paper, we show that
corpus combination is effective after all when the differences between corpora
are bridged with domain adaptation methods. When we combine the SemEval-2010
Task 10 and Gerber and Chai noun corpora, we obtain substantially improved
performance on both corpora, for all roles and parts of speech. We also present
new insights into the properties of the implicit semantic role labeling task.
