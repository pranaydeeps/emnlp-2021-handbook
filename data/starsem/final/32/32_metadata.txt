Abstract#==#The lexical semantic relationships between word pairs are key features for many
NLP tasks.  Most approaches for automatically classifying related word pairs
are hindered by data sparsity because of their need to observe two words
co-occurring for detecting the lexical relation holding between them. Even when
mining very large corpora, not every related word pair co-occurs.  Using novel
representations based on graphs and word embeddings, we present two systems
that are able to predict relations between words, even those never found in the
same
sentence in a given corpus.  In two experiments, we demonstrate superior
performance of both approaches over the state of the art, achieving significant
gains in recall.
