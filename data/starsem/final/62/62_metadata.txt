Abstract#==#This paper reports an approach to automatically generate a lexical resource to
support incremental semantic role labeling annotation in Portuguese. The data
come from the corpus Propbank-Br (Propbank of Brazilian Portuguese) and from
the lexical resource of English Propbank, as both share the same structure.  In
order to enable the strategy, we added extra annotation to Propbank-Br. This
approach is part of a previous decision to invert the process of implementing a
Propbank Project, by first annotating a core corpus and only then generating a
lexical resource to enable further annotation tasks. The reasoning behind such
inversion is to explore the task empirically before distributing the annotation
task and to provide simultaneously: 1) a first training corpus for SRL in
Brazilian Portuguese and 2) annotated examples to compose a lexical resource to
support SRL. The main contribution of this paper is to point out to what extent
linguistic effort may be reduced, thereby speeding up the construction of a
lexical resource to support SRL for less resourced languages. The corpus
Propbank-Br, with the extra annotation described herein, is publicly available.
