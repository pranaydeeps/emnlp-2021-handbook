Abstract#==#Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental technique in natural language processing.
It enables documents to be mapped to a concise set of phrases that can be used
for indexing, clustering, ontology building, auto-tagging and other information
organization schemes. Two major families of unsupervised keyphrase extraction
algorithms may be characterized as statistical and graph-based. We present a
hybrid statistical-graphical algorithm that capitalizes on the heuristics of
both families of algorithms and is able to outperform the state of the art in
unsupervised keyphrase extraction on several datasets.
