Abstract#==#We induce semantic association networks from translation relations in parallel
corpora. The resulting semantic spaces are encoded in a single reference
language, which ensures cross-language comparability. As our main contribution,
we cluster the obtained (cross-lingually comparable) lexical semantic spaces.
We find that, in our sample of languages, lexical semantic spaces largely
coincide with genealogical relations. To our knowledge, this constitutes the
first large-scale quantitative lexical semantic typology that is completely
unsupervised, bottom-up, and data-driven. Our results may be important for the
decision which multilingual resources to integrate in a semantic evaluation
task.
