Abstract#==#Readability depends on many factors ranging from shallow features like word
length to semantic ones like coherence. We introduce novel graph-based
coherence features based on frequent subgraphs and compare their ability to
assess the readability of Wall Street Journal articles. In contrast to Pitler
and Nenkova (2008) some of our graph-based features are significantly
correlated with human judgments. We
outperform Pitler and Nenkova (2008) in the readability ranking task by more
than 5% accuracy thus establishing a new state-of-the-art on this dataset.
