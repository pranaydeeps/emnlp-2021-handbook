Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose the use of word sense disambiguation and latent
semantic features to automatically identify a person's perspective from his/her
written text. We run an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment where we ask Turkers
to answer a set of constrained and open-ended political questions drawn from
the American National Election Studies (ANES). We then extract the proposed
features from the answers to the open-ended questions and use them to  predict
the answer to one of the constrained questions, namely, their preferred
Presidential Candidate. In addition to this newly created dataset,  we also
evaluate our proposed approach on  a second standard dataset of
"Ideological-Debates". This latter dataset contains topics from four domains:
Abortion, Creationism, Gun Rights and Gay-Rights.  Experimental results show
that using word sense disambiguation and latent-semantics, whether separately
or combined, beats the                                                  majority and
random
baselines
on the
cross-validation
and held-out-test sets for both the ANES and the four domains of the
"Ideological Debates" datasets. Moreover combining both feature sets
outperforms a stronger                                                  unigram-only
classification
system.
