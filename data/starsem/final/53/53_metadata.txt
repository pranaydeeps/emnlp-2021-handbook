Abstract#==#Based on the hypothesis that frame-semantic parsing and event extraction are
structurally identical tasks, we retrain SEMAFOR, a state-of-the-art
frame-semantic parsing
system to predict event triggers and arguments. We describe how we change
SEMAFOR to be
better suited for the new task and show that it performs comparable to one of
the best systems in event extraction. We also describe a bias in one of its
models and propose a feature factorization which is better suited for this
model.
