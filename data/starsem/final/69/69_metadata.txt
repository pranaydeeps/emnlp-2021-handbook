Abstract#==#We are proposing an extension of the recursive neural network that makes use of
a variant of the long short-term memory architecture. The extension allows
information
low in parse trees to be stored in a memory register (the `memory cell') and
used
much later higher up in the parse tree. This provides a solution to the
vanishing gradient
problem and allows the network to capture long range dependencies. Experimental
results
show that our composition outperformed the traditional neural-network
composition on the
Stanford Sentiment Treebank.
