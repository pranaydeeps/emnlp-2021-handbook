Abstract#==#We propose a novel method to learn negation
expressions in a specialized (medical) domain.
In our corpus, negations are annotated as ‘flat’
text spans. This allows for some infelicities
in the mark-up of the ground truth, making it
less than perfectly aligned with the underlying
syntactic structure. Nonetheless, the negations
thus captured are correct in intent, and
thus potentially valuable. We succeed in training
a model for detecting the negated predicates
corresponding to the annotated negations,
by re-mapping the corpus to anchor its
‘flat’ annotation spans into the predicate argument
structure. Our key idea—re-mapping the
negation instance spans to more uniform syntactic
nodes—makes it possible to re-frame
the learning task as a simpler one, and to leverage
an imperfect resource in a way which enables
us to learn a high performance model.
We achieve high accuracy for negation detection
overall, 87%. Our re-mapping scheme
can be constructively applied to existing flatly
annotated resources for other tasks where syntactic
context is vital.
