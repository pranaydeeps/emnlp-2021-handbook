Abstract#==#We describe a semantic role labeler with state- of-the-art performance and low
computational requirements, which uses convolutional and time-domain neural
networks. The system is designed to work with features derived from a
dependency parser output. Various system options and architectural details are
discussed. Incremental experiments were run to explore the benefits of adding
increasingly more com- plex dependency-based features to the system; results
are presented for both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.
