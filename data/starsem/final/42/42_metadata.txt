Abstract#==#Discourse deixis is a linguistic phenomenon in which pronouns have verbal or
clausal, rather than nominal, antecedents. Studies have estimated that between
5% and 10% of pronouns in non-conversational data are discourse deictic.
However, current coreference resolution systems ignore this phenomenon. This
paper presents an automatic system for the detection and resolution of
discourse-deictic pronouns. We introduce a two-step approach that first
recognizes instances of discourse-deictic pronouns, and then resolves them to
their verbal antecedent. Both components rely on linguistically motivated
features. We evaluate the components in isolation and in combination with two
state-of-the-art coreference resolvers. Results show that our system
outperforms several baselines, including the only comparable discourse deixis
system, and leads to a small but statistically significant improvement over the
state-of-the-art in full coreference resolution. A post-hoc error analysis
reveals the need for a less strict evaluation of this task.
