Abstract#==#Word Sense Disambiguation has been stuck for many years. In this paper
we explore the use of large-scale crowdsourcing to cluster senses that
are often confused by non-expert annotators. We show that we can
increase performance at will: our in-domain experiment involving 45
highly polysemous nouns, verbs and adjective (9.8 senses on average),
yields an average accuracy of 92.6 using a supervised classifier for
an average polysemy of 6.1. Our proposal has the advantage of being
cost-effective and being able to both produce different levels of
granularity. Our analysis shows that the error reduction with respect
to fine-grained senses is higher, and manual inspection show that the
clusters are sensible when compared to those of OntoNotes.
