Abstract#==#A range of approaches to the representation of lexical semantics have been
explored within Computational Linguistics. Two of the most popular are
distributional and knowledge-based models. This paper proposes hybrid models of
lexical semantics that combine the advantages of these two approaches. Our
models provide robust representations of sets of synonym words, synsets,
derived from WordNet. We also make use of WordNet's hierarcy to refine the
synset vectors. The models are evaluated on two widely explored tasks involving
lexical semantics: lexical similarity and Word Sense Disambiguation. The hybrid
models are found to perform better than standard distributional models and have
the additional benefit of modelling polysemy.
