Abstract#==#Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) utilizes the Wikipedia knowledge base to
represent the semantics of a word by a vector where every dimension refers to
an explicitly defined concept like a Wikipedia article. ESA inherently assumes
that Wikipedia concepts are orthogonal to each other, therefore, it considers
that two words are related only if they co-occur in the same articles. However,
two words can be related to each other even if they appear separately in
related articles rather than co-occurring in the same articles. This leads to a
need for extending the ESA model to consider the relatedness between the
explicit concepts (i.e. Wikipedia articles in Wikipedia based implementation)
for computing textual relatedness. In this paper, we present Non-Orthogonal ESA
(NESA) which represents more fine grained semantics of a word as a vector of
explicit concept dimensions, where every such concept dimension further
constitutes a semantic vector built in another vector space. Thus, NESA
considers the concept correlations in computing the relatedness between two
words. We explore different approaches to compute the concept correlation
weights, and compare these approaches with other existing methods. Furthermore,
we evaluate our model NESA on several word relatedness benchmarks showing that
it outperforms the state of the art methods.
