Abstract#==#Generics are linguistic expressions that make statements about or refer to
kinds, or that report regularities of events. Non-generic expressions make
statements about particular individuals or specific episodes. Generics are
treated extensively in semantic theory (Krifka et al., 1995). In practice, it
is often hard to decide whether a referring expression is generic or
non-generic, and to date there is no data set which is both large and
satisfactorily annotated. Such a data set would be valuable for creating
automatic systems for identifying generic expressions, in turn facilitating
knowledge extraction from natural language text. In this paper we provide the
next steps for such an annotation endeavor. Our contributions are: (1) we
survey the most important previous projects annotating genericity, focusing on
resources for English; (2) with a new agreement study we identify problems in
the annotation scheme of the largest currently available resource (ACE-2005);
and (3) we introduce a linguistically-motivated annotation scheme for marking
both clauses and their subjects with regard to their genericity. (4) We present
a corpus of MASC (Ide et al., 2010) and Wikipedia texts annotated according to
our scheme, achieving substantial agreement.
