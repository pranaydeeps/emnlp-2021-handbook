Abstract#==#Detecting and analyzing causal language is essential to extracting semantic
relationships. To that end, we present an annotation scheme for English causal
language (not metaphysical causality), and discuss two methodologies for
annotation. The first uses only a coding manual to train annotators in
distinguishing causal from non-causal language. To address low inter-coder
agreement, we adopted a second methodology, in which we first created a causal
language "constructicon" based on corpus analysis, then required annotators
only to annotate instances based on the constructicon. (This resembles the
methodology used for annotating the FrameNet and PropBank corpora.) Our
contributions, in addition to the annotation scheme itself, are methodological:
we discuss when constructicon-based methodology is appropriate, and address the
validity of annotation schemes that require expert-level metalinguistic
awareness.
