Abstract#==#The present paper describes an attempt to create an interoperable scheme for
the annotation of textual phenomena across languages and genres including
non-canonical ones. The resulting scheme will be tested for a contrastive
analysis of English, German and Czech, for which we expect the greatest
differences in the degree of variation between non-canonical and canonical
language. Such a kind of analysis requires annotated multilingual resources
which are costly. Therefore, we make use of annotations already available in
the resources for the three languages under analysis. As the annotations in
these corpora are based on different conceptual and methodological backgrounds,
we need an interoperable scheme that covers existing categories and at the same
time allows a comparison of the resources. In this paper, we describe how this
interoperable scheme was created and which problematic cases we had to
consider.
