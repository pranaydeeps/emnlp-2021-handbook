Abstract#==#We present our correction annotation guidelines to create a manually corrected
non-native (L2) Arabic corpus. We develop our approach by extending an L1
large-scale Arabic corpus and its manual  corrections, to include manually
corrected non-native Arabic learner essays. 

Our overarching goal is to use the annotated corpus to develop components for
automatic detection and correction of  language errors                    that can be
used
to
help Standard Arabic learners (native and non-native) improve the quality of
the Arabic text they produce. The created corpus of L2 text manual corrections
is the largest to date. We evaluate our guidelines using inter-annotator
agreement and show a high degree of consistency.
