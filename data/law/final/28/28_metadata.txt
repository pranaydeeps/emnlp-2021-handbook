Abstract#==#Aspect-based opinion summarization is the
task of automatically generating a summary
for some aspects of a specific topic from a
set of opinions. In most cases, to evaluate the
quality of the automatic summaries, it is necessary
to have a reference corpus of human
summaries to analyze how similar they are.
The scarcity of corpora in that task has been
a limiting factor for many research works. In
this paper, we introduce OpiSums-PT, a corpus
of extractive and abstractive summaries of
opinions written in Brazilian Portuguese. We
use this corpus to analyze how similar are human
summaries and how people take into account
the issues of aspects coverage and sentiment
orientation to generate manual summaries.
The results of these analysis show
that human summaries are diversified and people
generate summaries only for some aspects
maintaining the overall sentiment orientation
with little variation.
