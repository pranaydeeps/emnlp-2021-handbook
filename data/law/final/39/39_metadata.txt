Abstract#==#The importance of balancing linguistic considerations, annotation
practicalities, and end user needs in developing language annotation guidelines
is discussed. Maintaining a clear view of the various goals and fostering
collaboration and feedback across levels of annotation and between corpus
creators and corpus users is helpful in determining this balance. Annotating
non-canonical language brings additional challenges that serve to highlight the
necessity of keeping these goals in mind when creating corpora.
