Abstract#==#This paper presents a discussion of the problems surrounding the task of
annotating geographical entities on microblogs and reports the preliminary
results of our efforts to annotate Japanese microblog texts. Unlike prior work,
we not only annotate  geographical location entities but also facility
entities, such as stations, restaurants, shopping stores, hospitals and
schools.
We discuss ways in which to build a gazetteer, the types of ambiguities that
need to be considered, reasons why the annotator  tends to disagree, and the
problems that need to be solved to automate the task of annotating the
geographical entities. All the annotation data and the annotation guidelines
are publicly available for research purposes from our web site.
