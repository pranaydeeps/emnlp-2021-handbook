Abstract#==#This paper reports on an effort to develop a linguistically-informed annotation
scheme for sluicing (Ross, 1969), ellipsis that leaves behind a wh-phrase. We
describe a scheme for annotating the elided content, both in terms of a free
text representation and its degree of correspondence with its antecedent. We
demonstrate that we can achieve reasonable IAA (Krippendorff's alpha between
.78 and .88 across eight annotation types) and describe some of the novel
patterns that have arisen from this effort
