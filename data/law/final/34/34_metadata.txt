Abstract#==#Return-on-Investment (ROI) is a cost-conscious
approach to active learning (AL)
that considers both estimates of cost and
of benefit in active sample selection. We
investigate the theoretical conditions for
successful cost-conscious AL using ROI by
examining the conditions under which ROI
would optimize the area under the cost/benefit
curve. We then empirically measure the
degree to which optimality is jeopardized in
practice when the conditions are violated.
The reported experiments involve an English
part-of-speech annotation task. Our results
show that ROI can indeed successfully reduce
total annotation costs and should be considered
as a viable option for machine-assisted
annotation. On the basis of our experiments,
we make recommendations for benefit estimators
to be employed in ROI. In particular,
we find that the more linearly related a benefit
estimate is to the true benefit, the better the
estimate performs when paired in ROI with
an imperfect cost estimate. Lastly, we apply
our analysis to help explain the mixed results
of previous work on these questions.
