Abstract#==#English prepositions are extremely frequent and extraordinarily polysemous.
In some usages they contribute information about spatial, temporal, or causal
roles/relations; in other cases they are institutionalized, somewhat
arbitrarily, as case markers licensed by a particular governing verb, verb
class, or syntactic construction. To facilitate automatic disambiguation, we
propose a general-purpose, broad-coverage taxonomy of preposition functions
that we call supersenses: these are coarse and unlexicalized so as to be
tractable for efficient manual annotation, yet capture crucial semantic
distinctions. Our resource, including extensive documentation of the
supersenses, many example sentences, and mappings to other lexical resources,
will be publicly released.
