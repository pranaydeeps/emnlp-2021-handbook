Abstract#==#Progress in speech and language technologies has long been fueled by
large-scale data resources. Semantic resources that could facilitate deeper
language understanding are not, however, available on a comparable scale, and
are widely assumed to require prohibitive expense and expertise to create. This
paper focuses on the problem of annotating semantic frames and explores the
viability of crowdsourcing for the task of frame disambiguation. We present a
novel supervised crowdsourcing paradigm that incorporates insights from human
computation studies, as well as experimental results demonstrating the value of
feedback, interaction and other innovations designed to accommodate the
relative complexity of the task. These results suggest the feasibility of
developing scalable methodologies for semantic annotation tasks requiring an
intermediate level of expertise.
