Abstract#==#We examine some non-canonical annotation categories that license missing
material (ellipses and enumerations).  In extending these categories to learner
data, the distinctions seem to require an annotator to determine whether a
sentence is grammatical or not when deciding between particular analyses.  We
unpack the assumptions surrounding the annotation of learner language and how
these particular phenomena compare to competing analyses, pointing out the
implications for annotation practice and second language analysis.
