Abstract#==#In conjunction with this year’s LAW theme, “Syntactic Annotation of
Non-canonical Language” (NCL), I have been asked to weigh in on several
important questions faced by anyone wishing to create annotated resources of
NCLs. 

My experience with syntactic annotation of non-canonical language falls under
an effort undertaken at Carnegie Mellon University with the aim of building an
NLP pipeline for syntactic analysis of Twitter text. We designed a
linguistically-grounded annotation scheme, applied it to tweets, and then
trained statistical analyzers—first for part-of-speech (POS) tags (Gimpel et
al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2012), then for parses (Schneider et al., 2013; Kong
et al., 2014). I will review some of the salient points from this work in
addressing the broader questions about annotation methodology.
