Abstract#==#The potential of processing user-generated texts freely available on the web is
widely recognized, but due to the non-canonical nature of the language used in
the web, it is not possible to process these data using conventional
methodologies designed for well-edited formal texts. Procedures for properly
annotating raw web data have not been as extensively researched as those for
annotating well-edited texts, as also evident from the viewpoint of Turkish
language processing. Moreover, there is a considerable shortage of
human-annotated corpora derived from Turkish web data. The ITU Web Treebank is
the first attempt for a diverse corpus compiled from Turkish texts found on the
web. In this paper, we first present our survey of the non-canonical aspects of
the language used in the Turkish web. Next, we discuss in detail the annotation
procedure followed in the ITU Web Treebank, revised for compatibility with the
language of the web. Finally, we describe the web-based annotation tool
following this procedure, on which the treebank was annotated.
