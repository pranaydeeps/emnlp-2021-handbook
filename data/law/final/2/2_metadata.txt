Abstract#==#This paper presents a resource and the associated annotation process used in a
project of interlinking Czech and English verbal translational equivalents
based on a parallel, richly annotated dependency treebank containing also
valency and semantic roles, namely the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank. One of the main aims of this project is to create a high-quality and
relatively large empirical base which could be used both for linguistic
comparative research as well as for natural language processing applications,
such as machine translation or cross-language sense disambiguation. This paper
describes the resulting lexicon, CzEngVallex, and the process of building it,
as well some interesting observations and statistics already obtained.
