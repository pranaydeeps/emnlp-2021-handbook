Abstract#==#In this paper, we present design and construction of the first Italian corpus
for automatic and semi--automatic text simplification. In line with current
approaches, we propose a new annotation scheme specifically conceived to
identify the typology of changes an original sentence undergoes when it is
manually simplified. Such a scheme has been applied to two aligned Italian
corpora, containing original texts with corresponding simplified versions,
selected as representative of two different manual simplification strategies
and addressing different target reader populations. Each corpus was annotated
with the operations foreseen in the annotation scheme, covering different
levels of linguistic description. Annotation results were analysed with the
final aim of capturing peculiarities and differences of the different
simplification strategies pursued in the two corpora.
