Abstract#==#NegEx is a popular rule-based system used to identify negated concepts in
clinical notes. This system has been reported to perform very well by numerous
studies in the past. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of kernel methods
to extend the performance of NegEx. A kernel leveraging the rules of NegEx and
its output as features, performs as well as the rule-based system. An
improvement in performance is achieved if this kernel is coupled with a bag of
words kernel. Our experiments show that kernel methods outperform the
rule-based system, when evaluated within and across two different open
datasets. We also present the results of a semi-supervised approach to the
problem, which improves performance on the data.
