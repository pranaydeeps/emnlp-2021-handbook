Abstract#==#Statistical Machine Translation has come a long way improving the
translation quality of a range of different linguistic phenomena. With negation
however, techniques proposed and implemented for improving translation
performance on
negation have simply followed from the developersâ€™ beliefs about why
performance is worse.
These beliefs, however, have never been validated by an error analysis of the
translation output. In contrast, the current paper shows that an informative
empirical
error analysis can be formulated in terms of (1) the set of semantic elements
involved in the
meaning of negation, and (2) a small set of string-based operations that can
characterise errors in the translation of those elements. Results on a
Chinese-to-English translation task confirm the robustness of our analysis
cross-linguistically and the basic assumptions can inform an automated
investigation into the causes of translation errors. Conclusions
drawn from this analysis should guide future work on improving the translation
of negative sentences.
