Abstract#==#We propose a compositional method to assess the factuality of biomedical events
extracted from the literature. The composition procedure relies on the notion
of semantic embedding and a fine-grained classification of extra-propositional
phenomena, including modality and valence shifting, and a dictionary based on
this classification. The event factuality is computed as a product of the
extra-propositional operators that have scope over the event. We evaluate our
approach on the GENIA event corpus enriched with certainty level and polarity
annotations.
The results indicate that our approach is effective in identifying the
certainty level component of factuality and is less successful in recognizing
the other element, negative polarity.
