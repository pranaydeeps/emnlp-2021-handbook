Abstract#==#Level of committed belief is a modality in natural language, it expresses a
speak-er/writerâ€™s belief in a proposition. Initial work exploring this
phenomenon in the literature both from a linguistic and computational modeling
perspective shows that it is a chal-lenging phenomenon to capture, yet of great
interest to several downstream NLP applica-tions.  In this work, we focus on
identifying relevant features to the task of determining the level of committed
belief tagging in two cor-pora specifically annotated for the phenome-non: the
LU corpus and the Factbank corpus. We perform a thorough analysis comparing
tagging schemes, infrastructure machinery, feature sets, preprocessing schemes
and data genres and their impact on performance in both corpora. Our best
results are an F1 score of 75.7 on the FactBank corpus and 72.9 on the smaller
LU corpus.
