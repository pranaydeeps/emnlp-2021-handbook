Abstract#==#Free legal assistance is critically under-resourced, and many of those
  who seek legal help have their needs unmet. A major bottleneck in the
  provision of free legal assistance to those most in need is the
  determination of the precise nature of the legal problem.  This paper
  describes a collaboration with a major provider of free legal assistance,
  and the deployment of natural language processing models to assign
  area-of-law categories to real-world requests for legal assistance. In
  particular, we focus on an investigation of models to generate
  efficiencies in the triage process, but also the risks associated with
  naive use of model predictions, including fairness across different
  user demographics.
