Abstract#==#This paper presents a technique for the identification of participant slots in English language contracts. 
Taking inspiration from 
unsupervised slot extraction techniques, the system presented here uses a supervised approach to
identify terms used to refer to a genre-specific slot in novel contracts. We evaluate the system in multiple 
feature configurations to demonstrate that the best performing system in both genres of contracts omits the exact
mention form from consideration---even though such mention forms are often the name of the slot under 
consideration---and is instead based solely on the dependency label and parent; in other words, 
a more reliable quantification of a party's role in a contract is found in what they do rather 
than what they are named.
