Abstract#==#The recent explosion of social media services like Twitter, Google+ and
Facebook has led to an in- terest in social media predictive analytics â€“
automatically inferring hidden information from the large amounts of freely
available content. It has a number of applications, including: online targeted
advertis- ing, personalized marketing, large-scale passive polling and
real-time live polling, personalized recom- mendation systems and search, and
real-time healthcare analytics etc.
In this tutorial, we will describe how to build a variety of social media
predictive analytics for in- ferring latent user properties from a Twitter
network including demographic traits, personality, interests, emotions and
opinions etc. Our methods will address several important aspects of social
media such as: dynamic, streaming nature of the data, multi-relationality in
social networks, data collection and anno- tation biases, data and model
sharing, generalization of the existing models, data drift, and scalability to
other languages.
We will start with an overview of the existing approaches for social media
predictive analytics. We will describe the state-of-the-art static (batch)
models and features. We will then present models for streaming (online)
inference from single and multiple data streams; and formulate a latent
attribute pre- diction task as a sequence-labeling problem. Finally, we present
several techniques for dynamic (iterative) learning and prediction using active
learning setup with rationale annotation and filtering.
The tutorial will conclude with a practice session focusing on walk-through
examples for predicting latent user properties e.g., political preferences,
income, education level, life satisfaction and emotions emanating from user
communications on Twitter.
