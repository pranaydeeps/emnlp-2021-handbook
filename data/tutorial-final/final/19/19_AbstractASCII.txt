NAACL Tutorial on Social Media Predictive Analytics

Abstract:

The recent explosion of social media services like Twitter, Google+ and Facebook
has led to an interest in social media predictive analytics â€“ automatically inferring hidden
information from the large amounts of freely available content. It has a number
of applications, including: online targeted advertising, personalized marketing, large-scale
passive polling and real-time live polling, personalized recommendation systems
and search, and real-time healthcare analytics etc.

In this tutorial, we will describe how to build a variety of social media predictive analytics
for inferring latent user properties from a Twitter network including demographic
traits, personality, interests, emotions and opinions etc. Our methods will address several
important aspects of social media such as: dynamic, streaming nature of the data,
multi-relationality in social networks, data collection and annotation biases, data and
model sharing, generalization of the existing models, data drift, and scalability to other
languages.

We will start with an overview of the existing approaches for social media predictive
analytics. We will describe the state-of-the-art static (batch) models and features.
We will then present models for streaming (online) inference from single and multiple
data streams; and formulate a latent attribute prediction task as a sequence-labeling
problem. Finally, we present several techniques for dynamic (iterative) learning and
prediction using active learning setup with rationale annotation and filtering.
The tutorial will conclude with a practice session focusing on walk-through examples
for predicting latent user properties e.g., political preferences, income, education
level, life satisfaction and emotions emanating from user communications on Twitter.

Outline:

I. Overview of the existing approaches for social media analytics (15 mins)

II. Static (Batch) Prediction (30 mins)
 Classifiers: user-based vs. tweet-based predictions
 Features: lexical, network structure, affect, behavior etc.
 Homophily and attribute assortativity
 Generalization of the classifiers

III. Streaming (Online) Inference (30 mins)
 Bayes' rule: iterative Bayesian updates
 Predictions from multiple data streams
 Batch vs. online performance
 Data collection/annotation biases and classification performance
 User attribute prediction task as a sequence labeling problem

IV. Dynamic (Iterative) Learning and Prediction (30 mins)
 Iterative batch retraining with and without rationale filtering
 Active learning with and without oracle annotations
 Active learning with interactive iterative rationale annotations

Break (15 mins)

V. Practice session: building analytics for inferring user demographics, personality,
emotions and opinions (1 hour)
 Data and annotation schema description (data and models will be released)
 Walk-through python examples for static inference â€“ extracting features,
 training, testing for tweet-based e.g., emotions, opinions and user-based 
 e.g., demographic predictions.
 Walk-through python examples for streaming inference from multiple data
 streams e.g., friends, followers, user-mentions, retweets etc.

This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of probability, machine learning (supervised
classification, regression, and feature engineering) and basic coding skills in Python.
