Getting the Roles Right: Using FrameNet in NLP

Collin F. Baker, Nathan Schneider, Miriam R. L. Petruck, and Michael
  Ellsworth


The FrameNet lexical database (Fillmore & Baker 2010, Ruppenhofer et
al. 2006, http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu), covers roughly 13,000
lexical units (word senses) for the core Engish lexicon, associating
them with roughly 1,200 fully defined semantic frames; these frames
and their roles cover the majority of event types in everyday,
non-specialist text, and they are documented with 200,000 manually
annotated examples.  This tutorial will teach attendees what they need
to know to start using the FrameNet lexical database as part of an NLP
system. We will cover the basics of Frame Semantics, explain how the
database was created, introduce the Python API and the state of the
art in automatic frame semantic role labeling systems; and we will
discuss FrameNet collaboration with commercial partners. Time
permitting, we will present new research on frames and annotation of
locative relations, as well as corresponding metaphorical uses, along
with information about how frame semantic roles can aid the
interpretation of metaphors.

Collin Baker (International Computer Science Institute,
collinb@icsi.berkeley.edu), has been Project Manager of the FrameNet
Project since 2000. His research interests include FrameNets in other
languages (Loenneker-Rodman & Baker 2009), aligning FrameNet to other
lexical resources (Fellbaum & Baker 2013, Ferrandez et al 2010),
linking to ontologies and reasoning (Scheffczyk et al. 2010), and the
frame semantics of metaphor.



Nathan Schneider (University of Edinburgh, nschneid@inf.ed.ac.uk,
http://nathan.cl) has worked on a coarse-grained representation for
lexical semantics (2014 dissertation at Carnegie Mellon University)
and the design of the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR; Banarescu
et al. 2014). Nathan helped develop the leading open-source
frame-semantic parser for English, SEMAFOR (Das et al. 2010, 2014)
(http://demo.ark.cs.cmu.edu/parse), as well as a Python interface to
the FrameNet lexicon (with Chuck Wooters) that is part of the NLTK
suite.


Miriam R. L. Petruck (International Computer Science Institute,
miriamp@icsi.berkeley.edu) received her PhD in Linguistics from the
University of California, Berkeley. A key member of the team
developing FrameNet almost since the projectâ€™s founding, her research
interests include semantics, knowledge base development, grammar and
lexis, lexical semantics, Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar.



Michael Ellsworth (International Computer Science Institute,
infinity@icsi.berkeley.edu) has been involved with FrameNet for well
over a decade. His chief focus is on semantic relations in FrameNet
(Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), how they can be used for paraphrase
(Ellsworth & Janin 2007), and mapping to other resources (Scheffczyk
et al 2006, Ferrandez et al. 2010).  Increasingly, he has examined the
connection of FrameNet to syntax and the Constructicon (Torrent &
Ellsworth 2013, Ziem & Ellsworth 2015), including in his pending
dissertation on the constructions and frame semantics of emotion.
