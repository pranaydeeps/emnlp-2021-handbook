Abstract#==#The FrameNet lexical database (Fillmore and Baker 2010) covers roughly 13,000
lexical units (word senses) for the core Engish lexicon, associating them with
roughly 1,200 fully defined semantic frames; these frames and their roles cover
the majority of event types in everyday, non-specialist text, and they are
documented with 200,000 manually annotated examples. Although much of the NLP
community has heard of FrameNet and has a rough picture of what it is, to date,
only a few NLP researchers have fully explored the wealth of information that
FrameNet offers and how it differs from other resources such as PropBank. In
this tutorial, we cover recent developments like the new NLTK Python API that
make it easy to get started with FrameNet. 

This tutorial will teach attendees what they need to know to start using the
FrameNet lexical database as part of an NLP system. We will cover the basics of
Frame Semantics, explain how the database has been created and introduce the
Python API and the state of the art in automatic frame semantic role labeling
systems, and FrameNet collaboration with commercial partners. As time permits,
we will also discuss new research on frame semantic approaches to negation and
conditionals and the how frame semantic roles can aid the interpretation of
metaphors.
