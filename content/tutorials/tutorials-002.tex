  {Financial Opinion Mining}

  {\daydateyear, \tutorialmorningtime}


In this tutorial, we disassemble a financial opinion into 12 components. This tutorial starts by introducing the components one by one and introduces the related studies from both NLP technical aspects and the real-world applications. Besides, in the FinTech trend, financial service gets much attention from the financial industry. However, few studies discuss the opinion toward financial service. In this tutorial, we will also introduce this kind of opinion and provide a comparison with the opinion of investors and customer's opinions in other industries. Several unexplored research questions will be proposed. The audiences of this tutorial will gain an overview of financial opinion mining and figure out their research directions based on the proposed research agenda.
