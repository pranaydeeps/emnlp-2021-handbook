Welcome to the EMNLP 2021, the first hybrid conference in EMNLP’s history, which is to be held online and in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

EMNLP 2021 has received 3,717 full paper submissions, the largest number to date. After excluding papers withdrawn by the authors, and desk rejecting papers which violated the anonymity policy, the multiple submission policy, or the formatting requirements, we were left with 3,600 submissions to be sent out for review. Despite the record-breaking number of submissions, we were able to keep the acceptance rates at a similar level as past years. 841 submissions were accepted to the main conference. Among them, 315 were accepted as oral papers, and 526 were accepted as posters. The decision between oral and poster presentations was not based on the quality/merit of the papers, but on our understanding of what would be the best format for presentation of each individual paper.

We continued providing the acceptance option of ``Findings'', following last year’s initiative in the form of a companion publication, for papers that narrowly missed acceptance to the main conference, but were judged to be solid, well-executed research, and worthy of publication. After the review process, 445 papers were invited to be included in the Findings. 26 papers declined the offer, leading to 419 papers to be published in the Findings. Some statistics of the accepted papers are shown below.

To meet the reviewer demands of a large conference, we organized the program committee into 22 tracks, including a special ``Multidisciplinary and Area Chair Conflict of Interest'' track, based on the track information in past conferences. We also introduced a new track called ``Efficient methods for NLP'' to promote work aiming to reduce the costs of NLP design and experimentation, similar to the ``Green NLP'' tracks in EACL 2021 and NAACL 2021. In terms of submissions per track, 9 tracks received more than 200 submissions. Particularly popular were the tracks NLP Applications, Machine Learning for NLP, Machine Translation and Information Extraction, which have around 300 submissions each.

We adopted a hierarchical program committee structure similar to that of recent NLP conferences. For each area, we invited 1-4 Senior Area Chair (SACs), who worked with a team of Area Chairs (ACs) they nominated, as well as an army of reviewers that we put together. We used the submission numbers per track from past conferences to estimate the number of SACs and ACs required for each track, leading to 46 SACs and 237 ACs. For reviewer recruitment, we started with the reviewer lists from past conferences and sent out initial invitations asking reviewers to express their track preferences. We then passed the reviewer list to SACs and asked them to select reviewers from these candidate reviewers based on their expertise, and Semantic/Google Scholar profiles. Overall, this resulted in a total of 3,112 reviewers.

Each submission was assigned to three reviewers and one AC. The initial paper assignment was first made using an automatic algorithm to match the abstracts with ACs/reviewers' past publication records, then adjusted by SACs/PCs. We adapted the review forms from EMNLP 2020, NAACL 2021, and ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Besides the overall recommendation, reviewers were asked to evaluate how reproducible the results in the paper were, and whether there was any ethical concern. Our final decisions were made not just on the review scores, but also took into account the reviews, author responses, discussions among reviewers, meta-reviews and S(AC) recommendations. To ensure the review quality, we provided detailed guidelines about what reviewers should and shouldn't do in a review.

We also formed an Ethics Committee (EC) dedicated to ethical issues. 203 papers with ethical concerns raised by the technical reviewing committee were sent to the EC. The EC chairs went over the papers to determine whether a full EC review would be required. If so, the paper received one or two ethics reviews from additional reviewers recruited by the EC chairs. For any paper that was recommended to be accepted based on technical reviews and that had been referred to the EC, the EC chairs recommended one of the following to the PC chairs: (a) accept (12 EMNLP, 11 Findings), (b) conditionally accept (the ethical issues must be addressed in the camera-ready version; 17 EMNLP, 20 Findings), and (c) reject due to ethical issues (1 paper). The authors of all conditionally accepted papers (except 1 paper declining the Findings offer) submitted the camera-ready version and a short response that explained how they had made the changes requested by the EC meta-reviews. The EC chairs double-checked these revised submissions and responses, and confirmed that the ethical concerns had been addressed. As a result, all conditionally accepted papers were accepted to the main conference or Findings.

ACL Rolling Review (ARR) is a new initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics, where the reviewing and acceptance of papers to publication venues is done in a two-step process: (1) centralized rolling review and (2) submission to a publication venue. Working closely with the ARR organizers, we ran a pilot at EMNLP 2021. 17 papers (16 long, 1 short) were submitted via ARR to EMNLP 2021, accounting for 25\% of the ARR May submissions. After the decision process involving only PCs and SACs, 6 papers (5 long, 1 short) were accepted to the main conference, among which 2 papers were accepted orally. The other 5 long papers were accepted to the Findings. These papers will be published in the respective proceedings as any other EMNLP/Findings paper.

Based on the nominations from SACs and ACs, we identified 21 candidates for the best papers and outstanding papers award. These papers are assessed by the Best Paper Award Committee. The award winners will be announced at the closing ceremony.
EMNLP 2021 will also feature 28 papers accepted by the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) and 7 papers from the journal of Computational Linguistics (CL), out of which 29 will be presented as orals and 6 as posters.
Another highlight of our program is the three exciting keynote talks, presented by Professor Ido Dagan from Bar-Ilan University, entitled ``Where next? Towards multi-text consumption via three inspired research lines'', Professor Steven Bird from Charles Darwin University, entitled ``LT4All!? Rethinking the Agenda'', and Professor Evelina Fedorenko from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, entitled ``The language system in the human brain''.
