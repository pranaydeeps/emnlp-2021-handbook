The NAACL 2015 Social and Networking Event will be held immediately
following the Tuesday Poster Session and dinner in the Grand Ballroom
at the hotel. Here you will enjoy desserts, coffee and tea, and a cash
bar. Bring your boots and hats and follow along with our dance
instructors to learn the latest country line dancing, then practice
your moves to the sounds of a local DJ (who will play other sounds if
you tire of the country twang).  Enjoy networking with colleagues and
have a relaxing evening!

(We are trying a second-time experiment in holding a second poster dinner
and open-to-all desserts, drinks, and dancing social event combination
in place of the usual Banquet).

We hope to make your conference experience not only enlightening but
also entertaining and enjoyable!
