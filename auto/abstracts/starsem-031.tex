We induce semantic association networks from translation relations in parallel corpora. The resulting semantic spaces are encoded in a single reference language, which ensures cross-language comparability. As our main contribution, we cluster the obtained (cross-lingually comparable) lexical semantic spaces. We find that, in our sample of languages, lexical semantic spaces largely coincide with genealogical relations. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale quantitative lexical semantic typology that is completely unsupervised, bottom-up, and data-driven. Our results may be important for the decision which multilingual resources to integrate in a semantic evaluation task.
