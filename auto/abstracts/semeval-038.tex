Continuous word and phrase vectors have proven useful in a number of NLP tasks. Here we describe our experience using them as a source of features for the SemEval-2015 task 3, consisting of two community question answering subtasks: Answer Selection for categorizing answers as ``potential'', ``good'', and ``bad'' with regards to their corresponding questions; and YES/NO inference for predicting a ``yes'', ``no'', or ``unsure'' response to a YES/NO question using all of its ``good'' answers. Our system ranked 6th and 1st in the English answer selection and YES/NO inference subtasks respectively, and 2nd in the Arabic answer selection subtask.
