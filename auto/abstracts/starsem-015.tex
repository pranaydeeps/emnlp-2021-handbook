Most recent studies on coreference resolution advocate accurate yet relatively complex models, relying on, for example, entity-mention or graph-based representations. As it has been convincingly demonstrated at the recent CoNLL 2012 shared task, such algorithms considerably outperform popular basic approaches, in particular mention-pair models. This study advocates a novel approach that keeps the simplicity of a mention-pair framework, while showing state-of-the-art results. Apart from being very efficient and straightforward to implement, our model facilitates experimental work on the pairwise classifier, in particular on feature engineering. The proposed model achieves the performance level of up to 61.82\% (MELA F, v4 scorer) on the CoNLL test data, on par with complex state-of-the-art systems.
