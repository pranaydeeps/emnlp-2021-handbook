Event Mention detection is the first step in textual event understanding. Proper evaluation is important for modern natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present our evaluation algorithm and results during the Event Mention Evaluation pilot study. We analyze the problems of evaluating multiple event mention attributes and discontinuous event mention spans. In addition, we identify a few limitations in the evaluation algorithm and propose some potential improvements.
