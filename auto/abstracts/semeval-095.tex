This paper presents an overview of the system designed and submitted as part of our partici- pation to the SemEval-2015 Task 10 that deals with Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. We built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based su- pervised learning model for Subtask A (term level task) and Subtask B (message level task). We also participated in Subtask E viz., deter- mining degree of polarity with the system built employing the available lexical resources. Ex- periments with the official datasets show F1 scores of 81.31\% and 58.80\% for Task A and Task B, respectively. For Subtask E, our model achieved a score of 0.413 on Kendal's Tau metric.
