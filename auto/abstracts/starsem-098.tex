An English entity linking workflow is presented, which combines the annotations of five public open source entity linking services. The annotations are combined through a weighted voting scheme inspired by the ROVER method, which had not been previously tested on entity linking outputs. The combined results improved over each individual system's results, as evaluated on four different golden sets.
