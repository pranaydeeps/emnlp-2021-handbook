This paper describes various systems from the University of Minnesota, Duluth that participated in the CLPsych 2015 shared task. These systems learned decision lists based on lexical features found in training data. These systems typically had average precision in the range of .70 -- .76, whereas a random baseline attained .47 -- .49.
