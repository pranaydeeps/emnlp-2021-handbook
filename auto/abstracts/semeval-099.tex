This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2015 Task 12, and the opinion min- ing system sentiue. The general idea is that systems must determine the polarity of the sentiment expressed about a certain aspect of a target entity. For slot 1, entity and attribute category detection, our system applies a super- vised machine learning classifier, for each la- bel, followed by a selection based on the prob- ability of the entity/attribute pair, on that do- main. The target expression detection, for slot 2, is achieved by using a catalog of known targets for each entity type, complemented with named entity recognition. In the opin- ion sentiment slot, we used a 3 class polarity classifier, having BoW, lemmas, bigrams after verbs, presence of polarized terms, and punc- tuation based features. Working in uncon- strained mode, our results for slot 1 were as- sessed with precision between 57\% and 63\%, and recall varying between 42\% and 47\%. In sentiment polarity, sentiue's result ac- curacy was approximately 79\%, reaching the best score in 2 of the 3 domains.
