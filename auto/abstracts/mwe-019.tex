We present a domain-independent clustering-based approach for automatic extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs). The method combines statistical information from a general-purpose corpus and texts from Wikipedia articles. We incorporate association measures via dimensions of data points to cluster MWEs and then compute the ranking score for each MWE based on the closest exemplar assigned to a cluster. Evaluation results, achieved for two languages, show that a combination of association measures gives an improvement in the ranking of MWEs compared with simple counts of co-occurrence frequencies and purely statistical measures.
