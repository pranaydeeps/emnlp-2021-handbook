Medical texts are filled with mentions of diseases, disorders, and other clinical conditions, with many different surface forms relating to the same condition. We describe MINERAL, a system for extraction and normalization of disease mentions in clinical text, with which we participated in the Task 14 of SemEval 2015 evaluation campaign. MINERAL relies on a conditional random fields-based model with a rich set of features for mention detection, and a semantic textual similarity measure for entity linking. MINERAL reaches joint extraction and linking performance of 75.9\% relaxed F1-score (strict score of 72.7\%) and ranks fourth among 16 participating teams.
