Alzheimer's Disease, as other mental and neurological disorders, is difficult to diagnose since it affects several cognitive abilities shared with other impairments. Current diagnostic mainly consists of neuropsychological tests and history obtained from the patient and relatives. In this paper we propose a methodology for the characterization of probable AD based on the computational cognitive modeling of a language function in order to capture the internal mechanisms of the impaired brain. Parameters extracted from the model allow a better characterization of this illness than using only behavioral data.
