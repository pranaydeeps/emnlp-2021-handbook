We introduce a simple wrapper method that uses off-the-shelf word embedding algorithms to learn task-specific bilingual word embeddings. We use a small dictionary to produce mixed context-target pairs that we use to train embedding models. The model has the advantage that it (a) is independent of the choice of embedding algorithm, (b) does not require parallel data, and (c) can be adapted to specific tasks by re-defining the equivalence classes. We show how our method outperforms off-the-shelf bilingual embeddings on the task of unsupervised cross-language part-of-speech (POS) tagging, as well as on the task of semi-supervised cross-language super sense (SuS) tagging.
