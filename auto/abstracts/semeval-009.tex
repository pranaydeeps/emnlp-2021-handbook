Text is composed of words and phrases. In bag-of-word model, phrases in texts are split into words. This may discard the inner semantics of phrases which in turn may give inconsistent relatedness score between two texts. TrWP, the unsupervised text relatedness approach combines both word and phrase relatedness. The word relatedness is computed using an existing unsupervised co-occurrence based method. The phrase relatedness is computed using an existing unsupervised phrase relatedness function f that adopts Sum-Ratio technique based on the statistics in the Google n-gram corpus of overlapping n-grams associated with the two input phrases. The second run of TrWP ranked 30th out of 73 runs in SemEval-2015 task2a (English STS).
