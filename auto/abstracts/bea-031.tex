This paper identifies computational challenges in restructuring encyclopedic resources (like Wikipedia or thesauri) to reorder concepts with the goal of helping learners navigate through a concept network without getting trapped in circular dependencies between concepts. We present approaches that can help content authors identify regions in the concept network, that after editing, would have maximal impact in terms of enhancing the utility of the resource to learners.
