This paper presents a resource and the associated annotation process used in a project of interlinking Czech and English verbal translational equivalents based on a parallel, richly annotated dependency treebank containing also valency and semantic roles, namely the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank. One of the main aims of this project is to create a high-quality and relatively large empirical base which could be used both for linguistic comparative research as well as for natural language processing applications, such as machine translation or cross-language sense disambiguation. This paper describes the resulting lexicon, CzEngVallex, and the process of building it, as well some interesting observations and statistics already obtained.
