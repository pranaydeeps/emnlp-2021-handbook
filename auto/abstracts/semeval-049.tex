This paper describes our systems submitted to the target-dependent sentiment polarity classification subtask in aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task (i.e., Task 12) in SemEval 2015. To settle this problem, we extracted several effective features from three sequential sentences, including sentiment lexicon, linguistic and domain specific features. Then we employed these features to construct classifiers using supervised classification algorithm. In laptop domain, our systems ranked 2nd out of 6 constrained submissions and 2nd out of 7 unconstrained submissions. In restaurant domain, the rankings are 5th out of 6 and 2nd out of 8 respectively.
