This paper presents a summary of the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2015 shared and unshared tasks. These tasks aimed to provide apples-to-apples comparisons of  various approaches to modeling language relevant to mental health from social media. The data used for these tasks is from Twitter users  who state a diagnosis of depression or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and demographically-matched community controls.  The unshared task was a hackathon held at Johns Hopkins University in November 2014 to explore the data, and the shared task was conducted remotely, with each participating team submitted scores for  a held-back test set of users.  The shared task consisted of three binary classification experiments: (1) depression versus control, (2) PTSD versus control, and (3) depression versus PTSD. Classifiers were compared primarily via their average precision, though a number of other metrics are used along with this to allow a more nuanced interpretation of the performance measures.
