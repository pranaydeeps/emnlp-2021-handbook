Understanding the structure of scientific discourse is of paramount importance for the development of appropriate Natural Language Processing tools able to extract and summarize information from research articles. In this paper we present an annotated corpus of scientific discourse in the domain of Computer Graphics. We describe the way we built our corpus by designing an annotation schema and relying on three annotators for manually classifying all sentences into the defined categories. Our corpus constitutes a semantically rich resource for scientific text mining. In this respect, we also present the results of our initial experiments of automatic classification of sentences into the 5 main categories in our corpus.
