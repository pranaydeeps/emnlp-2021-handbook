The automatic induction of scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) from text has been the focus of many recent works. Most statistical approaches have focused on open-domain script acquisition, in which a large number of scripts may be learned, but the acquisition of any particular set of scripts is not guaranteed. For many specialized applications, however, knowledge of a few relevant scripts may be more useful than knowledge of many irrelevant scripts. In this paper, we employ a variety of known script-learning methods to learn Schank and Abelson's canonical restaurant script, using a novel dataset of restaurant narratives we have compiled from a website called ``Dinners from Hell.'' Our models learn narrative chains, script-like structures that we evaluate with the ``narrative cloze'' task (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008). Our results suggest that applying these techniques to a domain-specific dataset may be a reasonable way to learn domain-specific scripts.
