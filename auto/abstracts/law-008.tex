English prepositions are extremely frequent and extraordinarily polysemous. In some usages they contribute information about spatial, temporal, or causal roles/relations; in other cases they are institutionalized, somewhat arbitrarily, as case markers licensed by a particular governing verb, verb class, or syntactic construction. To facilitate automatic disambiguation, we propose a general-purpose, broad-coverage taxonomy of preposition functions that we call supersenses: these are coarse and unlexicalized so as to be tractable for efficient manual annotation, yet capture crucial semantic distinctions. Our resource, including extensive documentation of the supersenses, many example sentences, and mappings to other lexical resources, will be publicly released.
