Taxonomy structures are important tools in the science of classification of things or concepts, including the principles that underlie such classification. This paper presents an approach to the problem of taxonomy construction from texts focusing on the hyponym-hypernym relation between two terms. Given a set of terms in a particular domain, the approach in this study uses Wikipedia and WordNet as knowledge sources and applies the information extraction methods to analyze and establish the hyponym-hypernym relationship between two terms.  Our system is ranked fourth among the participating systems in SemEval-2015 task 17.
