We describe the system we developed to partic-ipate in SemEval 2015 Task 1, Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity in Twitter. We create simi-larity vectors from two-skip trigrams of prepro-cessed tweets and measure their semantic simi-larity using our UMBC-STS system. We submit two runs. The best result is ranked eleventh out of eighteen teams with F1 score of 0.599.
