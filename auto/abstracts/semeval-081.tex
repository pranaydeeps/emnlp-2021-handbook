We present the LIMSI submission to the Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task of SemEval-2015. The system exploits the parallelism of the multilingual test data and uses translations as source of indirect supervision for sense selection. The LIMSI system gets best results in English in all domains and shows that alignment information can successfully guide disambiguation. This simple but effective method can serve to generate high quality sense annotated data for WSD system training.
