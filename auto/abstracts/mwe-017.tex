This paper introduces NEMWEL, a system that performs Never-Ending MultiWord Expressions Learning. Instead of using a static corpus and classifier, NEMWEL applies supervised learning on automatically crawled news texts. Moreover, it uses its own results to periodically retrain the classifier, bootstrapping on its own results. In addition to a detailed description of the system's architechture and its modules, we report the results of a manual evaluation. It shows that NEMWEL is capable of learning new expressions over time with improved precision.
