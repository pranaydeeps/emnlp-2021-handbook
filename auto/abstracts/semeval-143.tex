In this paper we describe our entry to the SemEval 2015 clinical text analysis task. We participated only in the disorder attribute detection task 2a. Our main goal was to assess how well an information extraction system originally developed for a different task and domain can be utilized in this task. Our system, based on SVM and CRF classifiers, showed promising results, placing 3rd out of 6 participants in this task with performance of 0.857 measured in weighted accuracy, the official evaluation metric.
