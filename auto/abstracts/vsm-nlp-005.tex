In this paper a different machine learning approach is presented to deal with the coreference resolution task. This approach consists of a multi-classifier system that classifies mention-pairs in a reduced dimensional vector space. The vector representation for mention-pairs is generated using a rich set of linguistic features. The SVD technique is used to generate the reduced dimensional vector space. The approach is applied to the OntoNotes v4.0 Release Corpus for the column-format files used in CONLL-2011 coreference resolution shared task. The results obtained show that the reduced dimensional representation obtained by SVD is very adequate to appropriately classify mention-pair vectors. Moreover, we can state that the multi-classifier plays an important role in improving the results.
