Though the multiword lexicon has long been of interest in computational linguistics, most relevant work is targeted at only a small portion of it. Our work is motivated by the needs of learners for more comprehensive resources reflecting formulaic language that goes beyond what is likely to be codified in a dictionary. Working from an initial sequential segmentation approach, we present two important enhancements: the use of a new measure to promote the identification of lexicalized sequences, and an expansion to include sequences with gaps. We evaluate using a novel method that allows us to calculate an estimate of recall without a reference lexicon, showing our good performance relative to the second enhancement depends crucially on the first, and that our lexicon conforms much more with human judgment of formulaic language than alternatives.
