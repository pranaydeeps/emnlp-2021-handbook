The task of Native Language Identification (NLI) is typically solved with machine learning methods, and systems make use of a wide variety of features. Some preliminary studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of individual features, however, no systematic study of feature interaction has been carried out. We propose a function to measure feature independence and analyze its effectiveness on a standard NLI corpus.
