In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) of verbs, which can be directly applied to event mention detection task to classify event types. By using PropStore, a database of relations between words, our approach disambiguates senses of verbs by utilizing the information of verbs that appear in similar syntactic contexts. Importantly, the resource our approach requires is only a word sense dictionary, without any annotated sentences, or structures and relations between different senses (e.g. WordNet). Our approach can be extended to disambiguate senses of words in other types of part-of-speech besides verbs.
