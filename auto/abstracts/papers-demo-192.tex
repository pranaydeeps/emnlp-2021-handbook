We introduce iFacetSum, a web application for  exploring  topical  document  collections. iFacetSum integrates interactive summarization together with faceted search, by providing a novel faceted navigation scheme that yields abstractive summaries for the user selections. This  approach  offers  both  a  comprehensive overview  as well as particular  details regarding subtopics of choice. The facets are automatically produced based on cross-document coreference  pipelines, rendering  generic  concepts, entities and statements surfacing in the source texts. We analyze the effectiveness of our application through small-scale user studies that suggest the usefulness of our tool.
