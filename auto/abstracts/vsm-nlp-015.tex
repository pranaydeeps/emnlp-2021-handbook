Only very few users disclose their physical locations, which may be valuable and useful in applications such as marketing and security monitoring; in order to automatically detect their locations, many approaches have been proposed using various types of information, including the tweets posted by the users. It is not easy to infer the original locations from textual data, because text tends to be noisy, particularly in social media. Recently, deep learning techniques have been shown to reduce the error rate of many machine learning tasks, due to their ability to learn meaningful representations of input data. We investigate the potential of building a deep-learning architecture to infer the location of Twitter users based merely on their tweets. We find that stacked denoising auto-encoders are well suited for this task, with results comparable to state-of-the-art models.
