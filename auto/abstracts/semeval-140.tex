SpaceEval (SemEval 2015 Task 8), which concerns spatial information extraction, builds on the spatial role identification tasks introduced in SemEval 2012 and used in SemEval 2013. Among the host of subtasks presented in SpaceEval, we participated in subtask 3a, which focuses solely on spatial relation extraction. Unlike existing approaches to spatial relation extraction, we adopt an ensemble of binary classifiers for the task, where each classifier in our ensemble focuses on identifying a unique type of spatial relation. Our system was ranked first in the official evaluation, achieving an overall spatial relation extraction F-score of 84.5\%.
