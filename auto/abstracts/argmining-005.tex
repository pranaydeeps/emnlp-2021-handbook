We advocate a relation based approach to Argumentation Mining. Our focus lies on the extraction of argumentative relations instead of the identification of arguments, themselves. By classifying pairs of sentences according to the relation that holds between them we are able to identify sentences that may be factual when considered in isolation, but carry argumentative meaning when read in context. We describe scenarios in which this is useful, as well as a corpus of annotated sentence pairs we are developing to provide a testbed for this approach.
