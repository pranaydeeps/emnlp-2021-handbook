This paper presents an investigation of score prediction for the Organization dimension of an assessment of analytical writing in response to text. With the long-term goal of producing feedback for students and teachers, we designed a task-dependent model that aligns with the scoring rubric and makes use of the source material. Our experimental results show that our rubric-based model performs as well as baselines on datasets from grades 6-8. On shorter and noisier essays from grades 5-6, the rubric-based model performs better than the baselines. Further, we show that the baseline model (lexical chaining) can be improved if we extend it with information from the source text for shorter and noisier data.
