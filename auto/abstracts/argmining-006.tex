This paper presents preliminary work on identification of argumentation schemes, i.e., identifying premises, conclusion and name of argumentation scheme, in arguments for scientific claims in genetics research articles. The goal is to develop annotation guidelines for creating corpora for argumentation mining research. This paper gives the specification of ten semantically distinct argumentation schemes based on analysis of argumentation in several journal articles. In addition, it presents an empirical study on readers' ability to recognize some of the argumentation schemes.
