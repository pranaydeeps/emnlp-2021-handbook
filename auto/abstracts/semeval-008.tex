In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to word sense disambiguation based on evolutionary game theory. In our algorithm each word to be disambiguated is represented as a node on a graph and each sense as a class. The algorithm performs a consistent class assignment of senses according to the similarity information of each word with the others, so that similar words are constrained to similar classes. The dynamics of the system are formulated in terms of a non cooperative multi-player game, where the players are the data points to decide their class memberships and equilibria correspond to consistent labeling of the data.
