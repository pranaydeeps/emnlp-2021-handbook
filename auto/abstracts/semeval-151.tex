This paper describes the second version of the ASAP system and its participation in the SemEval-2015, task 2a on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). Our approach is based on computing the WordNet semantic relatedness and similarity of phrases from distinct sentences. We also apply topic modeling to get topic distributions over a set of sentences as well as some linguistic heuristics. In a special addition for this task, we retrieve named entities and compound nouns from DBPedia. All these features are used to feed a regression algorithm that learns the STS function.
