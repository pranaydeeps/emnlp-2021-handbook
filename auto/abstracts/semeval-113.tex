Sentiment analysis tends to focus on the polarity of words, combining their values to detect which portion of a text is opinionated. CLIPEval wants to promote a more holistic approach, looking at psychological researches that frame the connotations of words as the emotional values activated by them. The implicit polarity of events is just one aspect of connotative meaning and we address it with a task that is based on a dataset of sentences annotated as instantiations of pleasant and unpleasant events previously collected in psychological research as the ones on which human judgments converge.
