This paper presents a machine learning system that uses dependency-based features and lexical features for recognizing textual entailment. The system first generates a frame-based structured representation of the sentences using dependency relations obtained from Stanford Dependency parser. This structured representation is then used to evaluate a set of lexical and syntactic features. These features are simple and intuitive; easy to comprehend and evaluate. The system evaluates the feature values automatically without any manual effort or intervention. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by performing experiments on RTE1, RTE2 and RTE3 datasets. Decision trees are found to outperform other classifiers while SVM classifier using an RBF kernel shows comparable performance. Additionally, a comparative study of the current system with other ML-based systems for RTE to check the performance of the proposed system is also carried out. The dependency-based heuristics and lexical features from the current system have resulted in significant improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-art ML-based solutions for RTE. A task-based analysis of the current system for RTE1 dataset is also performed which, shows improved performance as compared to similar study performed by different researchers in the past.
