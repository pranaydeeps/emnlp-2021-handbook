This paper describes the first shared task on Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation organised as part of SemEval-2015. Participants were asked to find hypernym-hyponym relations between given terms. For each of the four selected target domains the participants were provided with two lists of domain-specific terms: a WordNet collection of terms and a well-known terminology extracted from an online publicly available taxonomy. A total of 45 taxonomies submitted by 6 participating teams were evaluated using standard structural measures, the structural similarity with a gold standard taxonomy, and through manual quality assessment of sampled novel relations.
