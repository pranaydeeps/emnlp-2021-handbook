The HLT-FBK system is a suite of SVMs-based classification models for extracting time expressions, events and temporal relations, each with a set of features obtained with the NewsReader NLP pipeline. HLT-FBK's best system runs ranked 1st in all three domains, with a recall of 0.30 over all domains. Our attempts on increasing recall by considering all SRL predicates as events as well as utilizing event co-reference information in extracting temporal links result in significant improvements.
