This paper presents our participation to the SemEval Task-17, related to ``Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation''. We propose a new methodology for semi-supervised and auto-supervised acquisition of lexical taxonomies from raw texts. Our approach is based on the theory of pretopology that offers a powerful formalism to model subsumption relations and transforms a list of terms into a structured term space by combining different discriminant criteria. In order to reach a good pretopological space, we define the Learning Pretopological Spaces method that learns a parameterized space by using an evolutionary strategy.
