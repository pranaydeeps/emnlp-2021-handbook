In this paper we present our solution for obtaining sentiment at message-level of short sentences. The system combines the use of polarity dictionaries and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to obtain syntactic and semantic features, which are afterwards fed to a statistical classifier in order to obtain the sentence polarity. Our solution was evaluated in the SemEval 2015 Task 10, subtask B: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, achieving competitive performance in all testsets.
