Language is the main communication device to represent the environment and share a common              understanding of the world that we perceive through our sensory organs. Therefore, each language might contain a great amount of sensorial elements to express the perceptions both in literal and figurative usage. To tackle the semantics of figurative language, several conceptual properties such as concreteness or imegeability are utilized. However, there is no attempt in the literature to analyze and benefit from the sensorial elements for figurative language processing. In this paper, we investigate the impact of sensorial features on metaphor identification. We utilize an existing lexicon associating English words to sensorial modalities and propose a novel technique to automatically discover these associations from a dependency-parsed corpus. In our experiments, we measure the contribution of the sensorial features to the metaphor identification task with respect to a state of the art model. The results demonstrate that sensorial features yield better performance and show good generalization properties.
