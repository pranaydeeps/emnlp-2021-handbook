Natural language processing and text analysis methods offer the potential of uncovering hidden associations from large amounts of un- processed texts. The SemEval-2015 Analysis of Clinical Text task aimed at fostering re- search on the application of these methods in the clinical domain. The proposed task consisted of disorder identification with normalization to SNOMED-CT concepts, and disorder attribute identification, or template filling. We participated in both sub-tasks, using a combination of machine-learning and rules for recognizing and normalizing disease mentions, and rule-based methods for template filling. We achieved an F-score of 71.2\% in the entity recognition and normalization task, and a slot weighted accuracy of 69.5\% in the template filling task.
