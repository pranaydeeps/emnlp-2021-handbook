Aspect-based opinion summarization is the task of automatically generating a summary for some aspects of a specific topic from a set of opinions. In most cases, to evaluate the quality of the automatic summaries, it is necessary to have a reference corpus of human summaries to analyze how similar they are. The scarcity of corpora in that task has been a limiting factor for many research works. In this paper, we introduce OpiSums-PT, a corpus of extractive and abstractive summaries of opinions written in Brazilian Portuguese. We use this corpus to analyze how similar are human summaries and how people take into account the issues of aspects coverage and sentiment orientation to generate manual summaries. The results of these analysis show that human summaries are diversified and people generate summaries only for some aspects maintaining the overall sentiment orientation with little variation.
