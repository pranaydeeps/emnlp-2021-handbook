Quantitative analysis of clinical language samples is a powerful tool for assessing and screening developmental language impairments, but requires extensive manual transcription, annotation, and calculation, resulting in error-prone results and clinical underutilization. We describe a system that performs automated morphological analysis needed to calculate statistics such as the mean length of utterance in morphemes (MLUM), so that these statistics can be computed directly from orthographic transcripts. Estimates of MLUM computed by this system are closely comparable to those produced by manual annotation. Our system can be used in conjunction with other automated annotation techniques, such as maze detection. This work represents an important first step towards increased automation of language sample analysis, and towards attendant benefits of automation, including clinical greater utilization and reduced variability in care delivery.
