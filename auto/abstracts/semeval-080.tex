In this paper we describe the SpRL-CWW entry into SemEval 2015: Task 8 SpaceEval. It detects spatial and motion relations as defined by the ISO-Space specifications in two phases: (1) it detects spatial elements and spatial/motion signals with a CRF model that uses a combination of distributed word representations and lexico-syntactic features; (2) given relation candidate tuples, it simultaneously detects relation types and labels the spatial roles of participating elements by using a combination of syntactic and semantic features in independent multi-class classification models for each relation type. In evaluation on the shared task data, our system performed particularly well on detection of elements and relations in unannotated data.
