This paper describes the system we submitted to In-domain ABSA subtask of SemEval 2015 shared task on aspect-based sentiment analysis that includes aspect category detection and sentiment polarity classification. For the aspect category detection, we combined an SVM classifier with implicit aspect indicators. For the sentiment polarity classification, we combined an SVM classifier with a lexicon-based polarity classifier. Our system outperforms the baselines on both the laptop and restaurant domains and ranks above average on the laptop domain.
