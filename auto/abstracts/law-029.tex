Recognizing the meaning of functional expressions is essential for natural language understanding. This is a difficult task, owing to the lack of a sufficient corpus for machine learning and evaluation. In this study, we design a new annotation scheme and construct a corpus containing 2,327 Japanese sentences and 8,775 functional expressions. Our scheme achieves high inter-annotator agreement with kappa score of 0.85. In the experiments, we confirmed that machine learning-based functional expression analysis contributes to factuality analysis.
