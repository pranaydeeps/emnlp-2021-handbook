Our participation at SemEval's Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task is described. An English entity linking (EL) system is presented, which combines the annotations of four public open source EL services. The annotations are combined through a weighted voting scheme inspired on the ROVER method, which had not been previously tested on EL outputs. Results on the task's EL items were competitive.
