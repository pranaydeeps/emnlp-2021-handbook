This paper describes the system submitted by the University of Wolverhampton and the University of Malaga for SemEval-2015 Task 2: Semantic Textual Similarity. The system uses a Supported Vector Machine approach based on a number of linguistically motivated features. Our system performed satisfactorily for English and obtained a mean 0.7216 Pearson correlation. However, it performed less adequately for Spanish, obtaining only a mean 0.5158.
