In this paper, we present the first attempt to integrate predicted compositionality scores of multiword expressions into automatic machine translation evaluation, in integrating compositionality scores for English noun compounds into the TESLA machine translation evaluation metric. The attempt is marginally successful, and we speculate on whether a larger-scale attempt is likely to have greater impact.
