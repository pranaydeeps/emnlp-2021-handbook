This work uses recursive autoencoders (Socher et al., 2011), word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014), associative matrices (Schuler, 2014) and lexical overlap features to model human judgments of sentential similarity on SemEval-2015 Task 2: English STS (Agirre et al., 2015). Results show a modest positive correlation between system predictions and human similarity scores, ranking 69th out of 74 submitted systems.
