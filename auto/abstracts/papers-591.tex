We present a new algorithm for transforming dependency parse trees into phrase-structure parse trees. We cast the problem as struc- tured prediction and learn a statistical model. Our algorithm is faster than traditional phrase- structure parsing and achieves 90.4\% English parsing accuracy and 82.4\% Chinese parsing accuracy, near to the state of the art on both benchmarks.
