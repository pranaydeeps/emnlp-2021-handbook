A major problem in research on Textual Entailment (TE) is the high implementation effort for TE systems. Recently, interoperable standards for annotation and preprocessing have been proposed. In contrast, the algorithmic level remains unstandardized, which makes component re-use in this area very difficult in practice. In this paper, we introduce multi-level alignments as a central, powerful representation for TE algorithms that encourages modular, reusable, multilingual algorithm development. We demonstrate that a pilot open-source implementation of multi-level alignment with minimal features competes with state-of-the-art open-source TE engines in three languages.
