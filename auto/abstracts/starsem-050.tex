This paper proposes a method of incrementally constructing semantic representations. Our method is based on Steedman's Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), which has a transparent correspondence between the syntax and semantics. In our method, a derivation for a sentence is constructed in an incremental fashion and the corresponding semantic representation is derived synchronously. Our method uses normal form CCG derivation. This is the difference between our approach and previous ones. Previous approaches use most left-branching derivation called incremental derivation, but they cannot process coordinate structures incrementally. Our method overcomes this problem.
