‎Answer Validation is an important step in Automatic Question Answering systems and nowadays by spreading Community Question Answering systems it is known as an important task by itself‎. ‎Previous works just considered it as a binary classification problem in which they try to find the best answer among all the candidate answers for a question‎. Accordingly, they do not consider the possible unique information which may have been included other answers‎. ‎This can be considered by having a multiclass label classification problem, it is not only able to find the best answer but also can find ``potentially good'', ``bad'', and etc‎. ‎answers too‎. By doing so, it is fully expected to extract and rate ‎all the necessary information from existing candidates to help questioner to find the best ‎and general answer for his question‎. ‎This work tries to consider some features which are gained from importance of comments of the questioner‎. ‎Finally‎, ‎by using a good classifier‎, ‎we try to overcome this problem‎. ‎The designed system participated in subtask A of the Semeval-2015 Task 3‎. ‎The primary submission ranked at the 5th and 7th places in four class label and three class label evaluation‎, ‎accordingly‎.
