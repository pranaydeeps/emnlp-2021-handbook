This paper presents a Retrospective Event Detection algorithm, called Eventy-Topic Detection (ETD), which automatically generates topics that describe events in a large, temporal text corpus.  Our approach leverages the structure of the topic modeling framework, specifically the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to generate topics which are then later labeled as Eventy-Topics or non-Eventy-Topics.  The system first runs daily LDA topic models, then calculates the cosine similarity between the topics of the daily topic models, and then runs our novel Bump-Detection algorithm.  Similar topics labeled as an Eventy-Topic are then grouped together.  The algorithm is demonstrated on two Terabyte sized corpuses - a Reuters News corpus and a Twitter corpus.  Our method is evaluated on a human annotated test set.  Our algorithm demonstrates its ability to accurately describe and label events in a temporal text corpus.
