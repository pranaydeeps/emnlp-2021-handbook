This paper describes the KLUEless system which participated in the SemEval-2015 task on ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter''. This year the updated system based on the developments for the same task in 2014 (Evert et al., 2014) and 2013 (Proisl et al., 2013) participated in all five subtasks. This paper gives an overview of the core features extended by different additional features and parameters required for individual subtasks. Experiments carried out after the evaluation period on the test dataset 2015 with the gold standard available are integrated into each subtask to explain the submitted feature selection.
