In this paper, we describe a morphological analyzer for learner Hungarian, built upon limited grammatical knowledge of Hungarian. The rule-based analyzer requires very few resources and is flexible enough to do both morphological analysis and error detection, in addition to some unknown word handling.  As this is work-in-progress, we demonstrate its current capabilities, some areas where analysis needs to be improved, and an initial foray into how the system output can support the analysis of interlanguage grammars.
