The DsUniPi team participated in the SemEval 2015 Task\#11: Sentiment Analysis of Figurative Language in Twitter. The proposed approach employs syntactical and morphological features, which indicate sentiment polarity in both figurative and non-figurative tweets. These features were combined with others that indicate presence of figurative language in order to fine-grain the predicted sentiment. The method is supervised and makes use of structured knowledge resources, such as SentiWordNet sentiment lexicon for assigning sentiment score to words and WordNet for calculating word similarity. We have experimented with different classification algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision trees, and Support Vector Machines), and the best results were achieved by an SVM classifier with linear kernel.
