Word Sense Disambiguation has been stuck for many years. In this paper we explore the use of large-scale crowdsourcing to cluster senses that are often confused by non-expert annotators. We show that we can increase performance at will: our in-domain experiment involving 45 highly polysemous nouns, verbs and adjective (9.8 senses on average), yields an average accuracy of 92.6 using a supervised classifier for an average polysemy of 6.1. Our proposal has the advantage of being cost-effective and being able to both produce different levels of granularity. Our analysis shows that the error reduction with respect to fine-grained senses is higher, and manual inspection show that the clusters are sensible when compared to those of OntoNotes.
