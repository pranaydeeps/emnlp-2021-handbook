We present a hybrid knowledge-based approach to multilingual word sense disambiguation using BabelNet. Our approach is based on a hybrid technique derived from the modified version of the Lesk algorithm and the Jiang \& Conrath similarity measure. We present our system's runs for the word sense disambiguation subtask of the Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task of SemEval 2015. Our system ranked 9th among the participating systems for English.
