This paper presents a Parallel Universal Dependency (PUD) treebank for the Indo-Aryan language, Bengali. The treebank consists of 1000 Bengali sentences created using a parallel corpus of English-Bengali and Hindi-Bengali. We use both the English and Hindi corpus from the Universal Dependency (UD) repository and subsequently the English corpus acts as the source text. The corpus was then translated and annotated in Bengali from scratch based on universal parts of speech tag, language specific parts of speech tag and syntactic levels. The paper also presents an illustration on the linguistic analysis of the PUD treebank.
