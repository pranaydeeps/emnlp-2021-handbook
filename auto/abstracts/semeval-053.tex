This paper provides a detailed description of the approach of our system for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task of SemEval2015. The task is to identify the Aspect Category (Entity and Attribute pair), Opinion Target and Sentiment of the reviews. For the In-domain subtask that is provided with the training data, the system is developed using a supervised technique called Support Vector Machine and for the Out-of-domain subtask for which the training data is not provided, it is implemented based on the sentiment score of the vocabulary. For In-domain subtask, our system is developed specifically for restaurant data.
