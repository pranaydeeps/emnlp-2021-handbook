This paper presents our participation in SemEval 2015 task 12 (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis). We participated employing only unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches. Our attempt is based on requiring the minimum annotated or hand-crafted content, and avoids training a model using the provided training set. We use a continuous word representations (Word2Vec) to leverage in-domain semantic similarities of words for many of the involved subtasks.
