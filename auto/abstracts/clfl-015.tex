In this paper, we investigate whether long- standing literary theories about nineteenth-century British novels can be verified using computational techniques. Elson et al. (2010) previously introduced the task of computa- tionally validating such theories, extracting conversational networks from literary texts. Revisiting their work, we conduct a closer reading of the theories themselves, present a revised and expanded set of hypotheses based on a divergent interpretation of the theories, and widen the scope of networks for validat- ing this expanded set of hypotheses.
