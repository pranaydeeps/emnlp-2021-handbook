Open forum threads exhibit a great variability in the quality and quantity of the answers they attract, making it difficult to manually moderate and separate relevant from irrelevant content. The goal of SemEval 2015 Task 3 (Subtask A, English) is to build systems that automatically distinguish between relevant and irrelevant content in forum threads. We extend a short answer assessment system to build relations between forum questions and answers with respect to similarity, question type, and answer content. The features are used in a sequence classifier to account for the conversation character of threads. The performance of this approach is modest in comparison to the other task participants and also to the per- formance the system usually reaches in short answer assessment. However, the new features implemented for this task are a first step in developing more fine-grained question-answer features and identifying relevant answers.
