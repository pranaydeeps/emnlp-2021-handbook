We propose a compositional method to assess the factuality of biomedical events extracted from the literature. The composition procedure relies on the notion of semantic embedding and a fine-grained classification of extra-propositional phenomena, including modality and valence shifting, and a dictionary based on this classification. The event factuality is computed as a product of the extra-propositional operators that have scope over the event. We evaluate our approach on the GENIA event corpus enriched with certainty level and polarity annotations. The results indicate that our approach is effective in identifying the certainty level component of factuality and is less successful in recognizing the other element, negative polarity.
