Visual Dialog is assumed to require the dialog history to generate correct responses during a dialog. However,  it is not clear  from previous work how dialog history is needed for visualdialog. In this paper we define what it means for visual questions to  require dialog history and we propose a methodology for identifying them. We release a subset of the Guesswhat?! questions for which their dialog history completely changes their responses. We propose a novel interpretable representation that visually grounds dialog history: the Region under Discussion. It constrains the image's spatial features according to a semantic representation of the history inspired by the information structure notion of Question  under Discussion. We evaluate the architecture on task-specific multimodal models and the visual transformer model LXMERT and show that there is still room for improvement
