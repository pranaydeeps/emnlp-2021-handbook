This paper describes our system used in the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Task 12 of SemEval-2015. Our system is based on two supervised machine learning algorithms: sigmoidal feedforward network to train binary classifiers for aspect category classification (Slot 1), and Conditional Random Fields to train classifiers for opinion target extraction (Slot 2). We extract a variety of lexicon and syntactic features, as well as cluster features induced from unlabeled data. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performances, ranking 1st for three of the evaluations (Slot 1 for both restaurant and laptop domains, and Slot 1 \& 2) and 2nd for Slot 2 evaluation.
