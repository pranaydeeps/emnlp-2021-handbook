Metaphor is a central phenomenon of language, and thus a central problem for natural language understanding. Previous work on the analysis of metaphors has identified which target concepts are being thought of and described in terms of which source concepts, but this is not adequate to explain what motivates the use of particular metaphors. This work proposes the use of conceptual schemas to represent the underspecified scenarios that motivate a metaphoric mapping. To support the creation of systems that can understand metaphors in this way, we have created and are publicly releasing a corpus of manually validated metaphor annotations.
