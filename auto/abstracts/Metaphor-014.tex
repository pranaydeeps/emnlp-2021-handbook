This paper describes a system that makes use of a repository of formalized frames and metaphors to automatically detect, categorize, and analyze expressions of metaphor in corpora.  The output of this system can be used as a basis for making further refinements to the system, as well as supporting deep semantic analysis of metaphor expressions in corpora. This in turn provides a way to ground and test empirical conceptual metaphor theory, as well as serving as a means to gain insights into the ways conceptual metaphors are expressed in language.
