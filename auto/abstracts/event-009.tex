Using clues from event semantics to solve coreference, we present an ``event template'' approach to cross-document event coreference resolution on news articles. The approach uses a pairwise model, in which event information is compared along five semantically motivated slots of an event template. The templates, filled in on the sentence level for every event mention from the data set, are used for supervised classification. In this study, we determine granularity of events and we use the grain size as a clue for solving event coreference. We experiment with a newly-created granularity ontology employing granularity levels of locations, times and human participants as well as event durations as features in event coreference resolution. The granularity ontology is available for research. Results show that determining granularity along semantic event slots, even on the sentence level exclusively, improves precision and solves event coreference with scores comparable to those achieved in related work.
