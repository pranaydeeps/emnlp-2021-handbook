{A}utomatically extracting interpersonal relationships of conversation interlocutors can enrich personal knowledge bases to enhance personalized search, recommenders and chatbots. {T}o infer speakers' relationships from dialogues we propose {PRIDE}, a neural multi-label classifier, based on {BERT} and {T}ransformer for creating a conversation representation. {PRIDE} utilizes dialogue structure and augments it with external knowledge about speaker features and conversation style.{U}nlike prior works, we address multi-label prediction of fine-grained relationships. {W}e release large-scale datasets, based on screenplays of movies and {TV} shows, with directed relationships of conversation participants. {E}xtensive experiments on both datasets show superior performance of {PRIDE} compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
