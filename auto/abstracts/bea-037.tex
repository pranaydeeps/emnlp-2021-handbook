The goal of the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing (AESW) Shared Task is to analyze the linguistic characteristics of scientific writing to promote the development of automated writing evaluation tools that can assist authors in writing scientific papers. The proposed task is to predict whether a given sentence requires editing to ensure its ``fit'' with the scientific writing genre. We describe the proposed task, training, development, and test data sets, and evaluation metrics.
