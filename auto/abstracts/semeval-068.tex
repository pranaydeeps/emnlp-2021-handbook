We implemented a syntactic and semantic tagging system for SemEval 2015 Task 15: Corpus Pattern Analysis. For syntactic tagging, we present a Dependency Chain Search Algorithm that is found to be effective at identifying structurally distant subjects and objects. Other syntactic labels are identified using rules defined over dependency parse structures and the output of a verb classification module. Semantic tagging is performed using a simple lexical mapping table combined with post-processing rules written over phrase structure constituent types and named entity information. The final score of our system is 0.530 F1, ranking second in this task.
