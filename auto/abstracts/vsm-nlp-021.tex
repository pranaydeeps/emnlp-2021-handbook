We replicate the syntactic experiments of Mikolov et al. on English, and expand them to include morphologically complex languages. We learn vector representations for Dutch, French, German, and Spanish with the WORD2VEC tool, and investigate to what extent inflectional information is preserved across vectors. We observe that the accuracy of vectors on a set of syntactic analogies is inversely correlated with the morphological complexity of the language.
