Concreteness and imageability have long been held to play an important role in the meanings of figurative expressions. Recent work has implemented this idea in order to detect metaphors in natural language discourse. Yet, metaphor is a rich linguistic resource, the import of which we are only just starting to understand, and like most aspects of natural language,it also involves affective meanings. We aim to demonstrate in this paper corpus-based and computational techniques for modelling the interactions between the underlying conceptual dimensions of metaphorical meaning and more social meanings like sentiment, and how doing so improves performance in such tasks as automatic detection of metaphor in discourse, and also in turn points to how we might better understand the complex models built to account for such interactions.
