Despite the growing cultural presence of eSports, no corpus contains this genre of entertainment. This paper presents how a preliminary corpus was created from broadcast speech from a professional game of the eSport Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The corpus was initially annotated following the Automatic Contact Extraction (ACE) event subtype definitions for game-changing events: deaths, injuries, and attacks. Event subtype definitions were modified for further annotation to detect a wider range of game-changing events otherwise not defined by ACE. A high degree of inter-annotator agreement for most event subtypes suggests that modifying event subtype definitions for an eSports corpus is necessary to detect the breadth of game-changing events.
