The exponential growth in the scientific literature in recent years has lead to a serious scholarly information overload on researchers. Automatically identifying the specific contribution made in a research paper would help quicker comprehension of the work, faster literature survey, comparison with the related works, etc. Here in this work, we propose a method to automatically extract the contribution statements from research articles. We design a model (ContriSci) multitask deep neural network leveraging section identification and citance classification of scientific statements to predict whether a given scientific sentence specifies a contribution or not. Our long-term goal, we create a knowledge graph of scientific contributions for machine comprehension and more straightforward navigation of research contributions for a particular domain. Our proposed model achieves the best performance over earlier methods (a relative improvement of 8.08\% in terms of F1 score) for contributing sentence identification over a dataset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) papers.
