As the use of Natural Language Processing systems increases, there is a need to address the gender bias in these systems. While research is being done in the English language to quantify and eliminate bias, it is not the same for Indic Languages. Most Indic languages are gendered, i.e., each noun is assigned a gender. Therefore, evaluation differs from what is done in English. In this paper, we evaluate and find occupational bias in Indic languages. We prepare a dataset of gender neutral occupations and gendered occupation pairs, in Hindi and Marathi.
