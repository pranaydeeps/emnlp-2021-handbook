We introduce an approach to word sense disambiguation and entity linking that combines a set of complementary objectives in an extensible multi-objective formalism. During disambiguation the system performs continuous optimization to find optimal probability distributions over candidate senses. Verb senses are disambiguated using a separate neural network model. Our results on noun and verb sense disambiguation as well as entity linking outperform all other submissions on the SemEval 2015 Task 13 for English.
