In this paper, we describe our approach to Semeval 2015 task 10 subtask B, message level sentiment detection. Our system implements a variety of classifiers and data preparation techniques from previous work. The set of features and classifiers used in the final system produced consistently strong results using cross-validation on the provided training data. Our final system achieved an F-score of 57.60 on the provided test data. The overall best performing system had an F-score of 64.84.
