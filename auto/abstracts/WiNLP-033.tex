To resolve what entities are being referenced by a user of a social bot, we implement both a rule-based (RB) and a fine-tuned neural coreference resolution model and compare how they perform on a set of pronominal types: it, they, that, she, he, her, him, his, and hers. The RB model harnesses the information found in our discourse model, which tracks and holds information of what entities are in focus. We trained our fine-tuned model on a dataset pulled from user logs from the topics of Movies, Sports, Television, and Music.  We find that our fine-tuned and RB models outperform an out-of-the-box AllenAI model that had no modifications or additional training.
