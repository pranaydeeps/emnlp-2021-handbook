Semantic knowledge has been adopted recently for SMT preprocessing, decoding and evaluation, in order to be able to compare sentences based on their meaning rather than on mere lexical and syntactic similarity. Little attention has been paid to semantic knowledge in the context of integrating fuzzy matches from a translation memory with SMT. We present work in progress which focuses on semantics-based pretranslation before decoding in SMT. This involves applying fuzzy matching metrics based on lexical semantics and semantic roles, aligning parse trees based on semantic roles, and pretranslating matching source sentence parts using aligned tree nodes.
