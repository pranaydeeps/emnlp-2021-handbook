Many languages, like English, lack a future tense, which makes the automatic identification of future reference a challenge. In this research we extend Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for use in the identification of future referring sentences. Building off a set of hand designed rules, we trained a ADAGRAD classifier to be able automatically detect sentences referring to the future. Uni-bi-trigram and syntactic rule mixed feature was found to provide the highest accuracy. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) indicated the existence of four major categories future orientation. Lastly, the results of these analyses were found to correlate with a range of behavioral measures, offering evidence in support of the psychological reality of the categories.
