Vector representations for language has been shown to be useful in a number of Natural Language Processing tasks. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of word vector representations for the problem of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. In particular, we target three sub-tasks namely aspect term extraction, aspect category detection, and aspect sentiment prediction. We investigate the effectiveness of vector representations over different text data and evaluate the quality of domain-dependent vectors. We utilize vector representations to compute various vector-based features and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate their effectiveness. Using simple vector based features, we achieve F1 scores of 79.91\% for aspect term extraction, 86.75\% for category detection, and the accuracy 72.39\% for aspect sentiment prediction.
