This paper presents a novel technique for empty category (EC) detection using distributed word representations. We formulate it as an annotation task. We explore the hidden layer of a neural network by mapping both the distributed representations of the contexts of ECs and EC types to a low dimensional space. In the testing phase, using the model learned from annotated data, we project the context of a possible EC position to the same space and further compare it with the representations of EC types. The closet EC type is assigned to the candidate position. Experiments on Chinese Treebank prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. We improve the precision by about 6 point on a subset of Chinese Treebank, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on CTB.
