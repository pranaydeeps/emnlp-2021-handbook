This paper proposes a shared task for the identification of the argumentative structure in newspaper editorials. By the term ``argumentative structure'' we refer to the sequence of argumentative units in the text along with the relations between them. The main contribution is a large-scale dataset with more than 200 annotated editorials, which shall help argumentation mining researchers to evaluate and compare their systems in a standardized manner. The paper details how we model and manually identify argumentative structures in order to build this evaluation resource. Altogether, we consider the proposed task as a constructive step towards improving writing assistance systems and debating technologies.
