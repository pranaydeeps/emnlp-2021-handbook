This paper presents our contribution to the SemEval-2015 Task 7. The task was subdivided into three subtasks that consisted of automatically identifying the time period when a piece of news was written (1,2) as well as automatically determining whether a specific phrase in a sentence is relevant or not for a given period of time (3). Our system tackles the resolution of all three subtasks. For this purpose multiple approaches are taken that use resources such as Wikipedia or Google NGrams. Final results are obtained by combining the output from all approaches. The texts used for the task are written in English and range from the years 1700 to 2000.
