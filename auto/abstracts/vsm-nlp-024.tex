Recent work in learning bilingual representations tend to tailor towards achieving good performance on bilingual tasks, most often the crosslingual document classification (CLDC) evaluation, but to the detriment of preserving clustering structures of word representations monolingually. In this work, we propose a joint model to learn word representations from scratch that utilizes both the context coocurrence information through the monolingual component and the meaning equivalent signals from the bilingual constraint. Specifically, we extend the recently popular skipgram model to learn high quality bilingual representations efficiently. Our learned embeddings achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 80.3 for the German to English CLDC task and a highly competitive performance of 90.7 for the other classification direction. At the same time, our models outperform best embeddings from past bilingual representation work by a large margin in the monolingual word similarity evaluation.
