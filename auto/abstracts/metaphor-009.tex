We present a supervised machine learning system for word-level classification of all content words in a running text as being metaphorical or non-metaphorical. The system provides a substantial improvement upon a previously published baseline, using re-weighting of the training examples and using features derived from a concreteness database. We observe that while the first manipulation was very effective, the second was only slightly so. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed.
