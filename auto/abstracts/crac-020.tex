Issues with coreference resolution are one of the most frequently mentioned  challenges for information extraction from the biomedical literature. Thus, the biomedical genre has long been the second most researched genre for coreference resolution after the news domain, and the subject of a great deal of research for NLP in general. In recent years this interest has grown enormously leading to the development of a number of substantial datasets, of domain-specific contextual language models, and of several architectures.  In this paper we review the state of-the-art of coreference in the biomedical domain with a particular attention on these most recent developments.
