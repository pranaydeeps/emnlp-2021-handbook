In this paper the system that was developed by Team UWM for the Task 14 of SemEval 2015 competition is described. Task 14 included two tasks: Task 1 was identification of disorder mentions and their normalization, and Task 2 was identification of the following attributes for                    disorder mentions: the CUI of the disorder, negation indicator, subject, uncertainty indicator, course, severity, conditional, generic indicator, and body location. For Task 1, an earlier system was applied that uses Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for disorder recognition and learned edit distance patterns for normalization. Task 2 was implemented by a simple method that finds the attribute terms around the disease mentions by matching them in the training data. Among all participants Team UWM was ranked fourth in Task 1, fourth in Task 2A (over gold-standard mentions) and third in Task 2B (over extracted mentions).
