Task 18 at SemEval 2015 defines Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicate---argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.  In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other language analysis sub-tasks, introduce and compare the semantic dependency target representations used, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results.
