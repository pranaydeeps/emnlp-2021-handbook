In this paper, we propose a baseline message-level sentiment classification method, as developed for SemEval-2015 Task 10, Subtask B.  This system leverages both hand-crafted features and document embedding features, and uses an SVM classifier for message-level sentiment classification. In pre-training the embedding features, we use 10 million randomly-selected tweets. We present results over SemEval-2015 Task 10, as well as the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our method over both datasets.
