This paper describes the USAAR-WLV taxonomy induction system that participated in the Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation task of SemEval-2015. We extend the work on using vector space models for hypernym-hyponym extraction by simplifying the means to extract a feature function that transforms any hyponym to its hypernym. This is done by capitalizing on function words that are often overlooked in vector space approaches to NLP. Our systems performs best in the chemical domain and has achieved competitive results in the overall evaluations.
