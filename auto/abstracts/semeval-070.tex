In this paper we present the Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL) are well-known problems in the Natural Language Processing field and both address the lexical ambiguity of language. Their main difference lies in the kind of meaning inventories that are used: EL uses encyclopedic knowledge, while WSD uses lexicographic information. Our aim with this task is to analyze whether, and if so, how, using a resource that integrates both kinds of inventories (i.e., BabelNet 2.5.1) might enable WSD and EL to be solved by means of similar (even, the same) methods. Moreover, we investigate this task in a multilingual setting and for some specific domains.
