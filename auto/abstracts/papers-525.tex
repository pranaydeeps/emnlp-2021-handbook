We present a simple and yet effective approach that can incorporate rationales elicited from annotators into the training of any off-the-shelf classifier. We show that our simple approach is effective for multinomial naive Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machines. We additionally present an active learning method tailored specifically for the learning with rationales framework.
