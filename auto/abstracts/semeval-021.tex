This report summarizes the objectives and evaluation of the SemEval 2015 task on the sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twitter (Task 11). This is the first sentiment analysis task wholly dedicated to analyzing figurative language on Twitter. Specifically, three broad classes of figurative language were considered: irony, sarcasm and metaphor. Gold standard sets of 8000 training tweets and 4000 test tweets were annotated using workers on the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. Participating systems were required to provide a fine-grained sentiment score on an 11-point scale (-5 to +5, including 0 for neutral intent) for each tweet, and systems were evaluated against the gold standard using both a Cosine-similarity and a Mean-Squared-Error measure.
