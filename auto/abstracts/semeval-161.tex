This paper presents the University of Turku entry to the SemEval-2015 task on Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing. The system uses an existing transition-based parser as a sequence classifier to jointly predict all arguments of one candidate predicate at a time. Compared to our 2014 entry, the 2015 system gains about 3pp in terms of F-score for a fraction of the development time. Depending on the subtask, the difference between our entry and the winning system ranges between 1 and 5pp.
