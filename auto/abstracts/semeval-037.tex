This paper presents the HITSZ-ICRC system designed for the QA TempEval challenge in SemEval-2015. The system used an integration approach to annotate temporal information by merging temporal annotation results from different temporal annotators. TIPSemB, ClearTK and TARSQI were used as temporal annotators to get candidate temporal annotation results. Evaluation demonstrated that our system was effective for improving the performance of temporal information annotation, and achieved recalls of 0.18, 0.26 and 0.19 on Blog, News and Wikipedeia test sets.
