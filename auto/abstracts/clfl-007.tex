We present a manually annotated word alignment of Franz Kafka's ``Verwandlung'' and use this as a controlled test case to assess the principled usefulness of word alignment as an additional information source for the (monolingually motivated) identification of literary characters, focusing on the technically well-explored task of co-reference resolution. This pilot set-up allows us to illustrate a number of methodological components interacting in a modular architecture. In general, co-reference resolution is a relatively hard task, but the availability of word-aligned translations can provide additional indications, as there is a tendency for translations to explicate underspecified or vague passages.
