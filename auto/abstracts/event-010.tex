This paper describes the processes and issues of annotating event nuggets based on DEFT ERE Annotation Guidelines v1.3 and TAC KBP Event Detection Annotation Guidelines 1.7. Using Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (brat), newswire and discussion forum documents were annotated. One of the challenges arising from human annotation of documents is annotators' disagreement about the way of tagging events. We propose using Event Nuggets to help meet the definitions of the specific type/subtypes which are part of this project. We present case studies of several examples of event annotation issues, including discontinuous multi-word events representing single events. Annotation statistics and consistency analysis is provided to characterize the inter-annotator agreement, considering single term events and multi-word events which are both continuous and discontinuous. Consistency analysis is conducted using a scorer to compare first pass annotated files against adjudicated files.
