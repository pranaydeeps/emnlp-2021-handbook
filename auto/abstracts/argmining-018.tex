Online debates sparkle argumentative discussions from which generally accepted arguments often emerge. We consider the task of unsupervised identification of prominent argument in online debates. As a first step, in this paper we perform a cluster analysis using semantic textual similarity to detect similar arguments. We perform a preliminary cluster evaluation and error analysis based on cluster-class matching against a manually labeled dataset.
