We present our submission to SemEval-2015 Task 7: Diachronic Text Evaluation, in which we approach the task of assigning a date to a text as a multi-class classification problem. We extract n-gram features from the text at the letter, word, and syntactic level, and use these to train a classifier on date-labeled training data. We also incorporate date probabilities of syntactic features as estimated from a very large external corpus of books. Our system achieved the highest performance of all systems on subtask 2: identifying texts by specific time language use.
