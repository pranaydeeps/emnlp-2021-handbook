Microblogs are considered as We-Media information with many real-time opinions. This paper presents a Twitter-OpinMiner system for Twitter sentiment analysis evaluation at SemEval 2015. Our approach stems from two different angles: topic detection for discovering the sentiment distribution on different topics and sentiment analysis based on a variety of features. Moreover, we also implemented intra-sentence discourse relations for polarity identification. We divided the discourse relations into 4 predefined categories, including continuation, contrast, condition, and cause. These relations could facilitate us to eliminate polarity ambiguities in compound sentences where both positive and negative sentiments are appearing. Based on the SemEval 2014 and SemEval 2015 Twitter sentiment analysis task datasets, the experimental results show that the performance of Twitter-OpinMiner could effectively recognize opinionated messages and identify the polarities.
