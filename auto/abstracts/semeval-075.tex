We explore using recursive autoencoders for SemEval 2015 Task 1: Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity in Twitter. Our paraphrase detection system makes use of phrase-structure parse tree embeddings that are then provided as input to a conventional supervised classification model. We achieve an F1 score of 0.45 on paraphrase identification and a Pearson correlation of 0.303 on computing semantic similarity.
