Past approaches to translate a phrase in a language L1 to a language L2 using a dictionary based approach require grammar rules to restructure initial translations. This paper introduces a novel method without using any grammar rules to translate a given phrase in L1, which does not exist in the dictionary, to L2. We require at least one L1---L2 bilingual dictionary and n-gram data in L2. The average manual evaluation score of our translations is 4.29/5.00, which implies very high quality.
