We describe the evolution of the Entities, Relations and Events (ERE) annotation task, created to support research and technology development within the DARPA DEFT program. We begin by describing the specification for Light ERE annotation, including the motivation for the task within the context of DEFT. We discuss the transition from Light ERE to a more complex Rich ERE specification, enabling more comprehensive treatment of phenomena of interest to DEFT.
