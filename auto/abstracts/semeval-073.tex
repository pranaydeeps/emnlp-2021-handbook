Following the footsteps of SemEval-2014 Task 4, SemEval-2015 too had a task dedicated to aspect-level sentiment analysis, which saw participation from over 25 teams. In Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) the aim is to identify the aspects of entities and the sentiment expressed for each aspect. In this paper, we present a detailed description of our system, that stood 4th in Aspect Category subtask (slot 1), 7th in Opinion Target Expression subtask (slot 2) and 8th in Sentiment Polarity subtask (slot 3) on the Restaurant datasets.
