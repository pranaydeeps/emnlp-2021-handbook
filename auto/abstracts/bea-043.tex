In this work, we explore applications of automatic essay scoring (AES) to a corpus of essays written by college freshmen and discuss the challenges we faced. While most AES systems evaluate highly constrained writing, we developed a system that handles open-ended, long-form writing.  We present a novel corpus for this task, containing more than 3,000 essays and drafts written for a freshman writing course. We describe statistical analysis of the corpus and identify problems with automatically scoring this type of data. Finally, we demonstrate how to overcome grader bias by using a multi-task setup, and predict scores as well as human graders on a different dataset. Finally, we discuss how AES can help teachers assign more uniform grades.
