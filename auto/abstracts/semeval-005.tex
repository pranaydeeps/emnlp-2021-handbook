Building unified timelines from a collection of written news articles requires cross-document event coreference resolution and temporal relation extraction. In this paper we present an approach event coreference resolution according to: a) similar temporal information, and b) similar semantic arguments. Temporal information is detected using an automatic temporal information system (TIPSem), while semantic information is represented by means of LDA Topic Modeling. The evaluation of our approach shows that it obtains the highest Micro-average F-score results in the SemEval-2015 Task 4: ``TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering'' (25.36\% for TrackB, 23.15\% for SubtrackB), with an improvement of up to 6\% in comparison to the other systems. However, our experiment also showed some drawbacks in the Topic Modeling approach that degrades performance of the system.
