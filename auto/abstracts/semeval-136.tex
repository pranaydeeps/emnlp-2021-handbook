In this paper we describe a system that aims to recognize paraphrases in Twitter by predicting if two tweets from the same topic are semantically similar. The system participated in Task1 of SemEval-2015 and uses a support vector regression machine (SVR) to predict the degree of similarity. The predicted is then threshold to create binary predictions. The model is and experimental results are discussed along with future work that could improve the method.
